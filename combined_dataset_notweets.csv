"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close   á
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my á
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had á
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the á
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was á
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all á
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the á
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my á
studies. á

"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the á

diligence had paid and I was very happy.",joy

impression of me.",joy
"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á
say anything but just watched me leave.",anger

like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \ A failure",anger
"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á

days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á
child to teach.",anger

would think that I had not prepared for it.",sadness
