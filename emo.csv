How awesome is this country?@joy
Had a lovely birthday yesterday with Alex and Christine.@joy
Been seeing so many good friends and refilling my cell-phone contacts.@joy
Visiting Bard was like a warm blanket.@joy
Earlham is also making me feel more happy than I feel at home.@joy
"Oh and also, I'm listening to an audio book of ""The Time-Traveler's Wife"" and loving it."@joy
Octoberfest was awesome.@joy
I also got a ton of compliments including from a couple of strippers that weren't even mine.@joy
What a ridiculously awesome time I had yesterday.@joy
It must have been all your good lucks and have funs that did it.@joy
Really starting to lose it.@sadness
Sadness Dept: Just heard on NPR that Gillo Pontecorvo died.@sadness
(I screened it at VSU in '04 for my faculty advisors and they seemed fairly stunned by it.@surprise
Strange.)@surprise
Ogro is a Franco-era policier and all the more grim for its muted tone and washed-out palette.@sadness
"""The most wonderful gift that dad got this birthday was the love ofamitabh-abhishek09.jpg his fans that he gets every year."@joy
"""What a fabulous gift for dad on his birthday!"@joy
Its fantastic.@joy
Well, great.@joy
We as a family are truly honoured.@joy
"Its a matter of pride for every Indian when a recognition like this comes to dad from a cinema-savvy country like France."""@joy
"""I think its a wonderful idea to remake Sholay."@joy
"All I can say is, knowing Ramus abilities from close quarters Im pretty sure even Ramesh uncle will be very proud of the film Ramu makes."""@joy
The show is coming together awesome.@joy
But the rest of it came across as a really angry, drunken rant.@anger
If anyone wants to give me a call I'd be more than happy to answer it.@joy
lol.@joy
My howland friend Alyssa came with me and we danced the night away.Most of my friends went which was awsome.@joy
there was only a few of us single people there but it was cool.@joy
which is one of the slow songs i got to dance with one of my friends Nick who graduated Mathews last year.Hes awsome we danced alot together!Luvs!@joy
the dance was awsome.The music was really cool.@joy
too much rap and not enough rock for my taste but it was all good I was just happy getting out on the dance floor and getting my groove on.lol.@joy
I also got to see some howland people i once knew (Drew was one) That was pretty cool!@joy
haha We did the Cha Cha slide and we were all so close together.@joy
I just loved last night!!@joy
Ha!@joy
then Lyssa,me,matt,and Kayla couldn't find someplace good to eat that was open 1 in the morning so we all went in to giant eagle and bought junk food haha.@joy

hehe@joy
however i do miss volleyball.@sadness
"I woke up once during the dream and was like, ""oh crap, no, go back"" and managed to get back to it somehow."@anger
So in the dream there were times where we were both kinda unsure, but it was still happy (for the both of us I hope).@joy
That's odd though, as I don't usually care for dressy occassions.@surprise
i'm finally reading the amazing adventures of kavalier &amp; clay.@surprise
i'm not very far along but i'm quite enjoying it.@joy
I'm in Buena Vista at these hot springs and it should be awesome but I didn't sleep one little bit last night.@joy
I think the pain and awkwardness of attending your reception is worth seeing your face again.@sadness
I miss you so much.@sadness
I've never missed anyone so much as you.@sadness
I'm sitting here in this lobby thing and crying and it's very embarassing but I can't help it because I just want you and me to run away and I want you to hold me for one whole night and rock me to sleep.@sadness
I miss you.@sadness
Well Im finishing up my first week at Jubans, its really awesome.@joy
We get drinks after work too and the food I can eat is awesome.@joy
Well, not so much an orgy, but really rather amusing!@joy
I just stood there in shock!@surprise
Another slight parallel I find amusing: Jason played Heracles in Alcestes last year, just as I am playing Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night's Dream.@joy
Sock n' Buskin is a really fun theatre company, I'm liking my occaisional rehersal.@joy
This awesome program@joy
I've been talking to Laura on the phone almost daily, and we're both very excited to see that little baby growing inside of her!@joy
That would be so awesome!@joy
Snow in October!@surprise
I haven't even seen snow in years and to have it in October it too much to wrap around my little head!@surprise
I'm missing everyone in Wisconsin with the Blue Stars, and sad that I had to leave early.@sadness
Miss you guys!@sadness
And sadly.@sadness
It was too much weight for me to carry, my own plus everyone elses.@sadness
I get a jolt of something REAL loud and it makes me jump.@surprise
I hope that he can learn to play well and I really do hope he is enjoying himself.@joy
No matter the pain is may cause the rest of the family.@sadness
As long as he is happy.@joy
Vegas was a lot of fun.@joy
The reception was a friggen blast!@joy
Champagne, music, and me trying to catch those damn flowers.@joy
"(didn't catch em by the by) Imagine this: My bro taking his neck tie off of marie's thigh with his teeth while ""girls just wanna have fun"" blasts in the background!"@joy
add some jack and cokes and a wendy's drive through and it's a REAL party!!@joy
My mother truly wants to murder my father, and then gets pissed off when i don't agree with her.@anger
Basically, I just want to focus on staying busy and staying happy.@joy
"So, if you would like to contribute to the ""make me smile"" foundation"", let's party!"@joy
that was sooo fun.@joy
lol.@joy
hehehehhe ;) neeeways.@joy
WE WERE TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!@joy
lol.@joy
We won by several of points.@joy
yay!!!!@joy
lol.@joy
after the game we went to the dance where I had the best night of my life!!!@joy
was so awesome.@joy
I cant even explain in words how much fun I had.@joy
;) hehehehe.@joy
I can honestly say that was the best Homecomg ever!!!!@joy
Its soooo sad b/c it was my last one.@sadness
:( at least I had a blast!!!!@joy
lol.@joy
I dont know what else to say except that I love spending time w/ Joe.@joy
:) *sighs* lol.@joy
And hanging out w/ Celeste and Matt was totally awesome 2!!!@joy
Love u all!!@joy
Exciting, no?@joy
We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well.@joy
But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe.@surprise
Fun times.@joy
And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen.@joy
It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.@surprise
I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life.@joy
It was sooooo much fun!@joy
I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed.@joy
Now this was amazing.@surprise
The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire.@surprise
That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more.@joy
I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun.@joy
Loved London.@joy
Loved the free museums.@joy
And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand.@joy
Curious.@surprise
The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans.@surprise
Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs.@joy
Loads of fun.@joy
So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc. It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds.@joy
Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup.@surprise
People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments.@joy
Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone.@joy
After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus.@joy
Now this was ridiculous amounts of fun!@joy
And the city itself really is lovely, in it's own way.@joy
Now this was really amazing.@surprise
And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean.@surprise
The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close!@surprise
Cyprus was amazing.@surprise
We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival.@surprise
We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights.@surprise
They did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel, refusing to let us pay for anything, and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be.@joy
Imagine the most incredible, horseshoe shaped cove, with unimaginably blue water, and a giant stone underneath the water, hundreds of meters long and wide, adding depth to the color.@surprise
It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about.@joy
Oh and the food is incredible.@surprise
Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones.@joy
So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years.@joy
We had a ball in Zurich.@joy
We went on a walking tour, went to the City Museum (located in an old castle, very cool), and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views.@joy
The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water.@surprise
The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing.@joy
The people are absolutely LOVELY.@joy
We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people.@joy
Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were.@surprise
And they all seem to really enjoy their city.@joy
They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it.@joy
And man, it is gorgeous.@joy
There was a fabulous sense of community there.@joy
My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs'.@joy
"I thought: ""that's strange, what's that about?"""@surprise
Vive la France!@joy
We really had a ball in Paris.@joy
We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour.@joy
The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it.@surprise
It's a pretty breathtaking sight.@joy
On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit.@joy
Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris.@joy
What an incredible end to an incredible journey.@surprise
I was also lucky enough to be hired to direct a show for Frenship high school, which went up last Sunday.@joy
It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well.@joy
It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time.@joy
I'm excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there.@joy
I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming (rapidly approaching) holiday season!@joy
I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season.@joy
Some of my teachers seem quite amazing, and others I know for a fact to be amazing.@surprise
So, all-in-all, pretty good, right?@joy
"You can handle high school drama."") Also, I have so many friends, and all of them are true, caring, trustworthy friends who love me and are supporting me 100%."@joy
I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace.@joy
This is my year to be happy.@joy
This is my year to try new things and to succeed!@joy
This is my first year of loving myself.@joy

This is my first year of loving myself.@joy
I look forward to learning and discovering even more of who I am, and loving every inch of it.@joy
I cannot believe the nerve of this man. God.@surprise
kill something.@anger
What's even worse, it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off, so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all, which is often impossible because so much is left out.@anger
Again, makes me so angry.@anger
Poopy poopy poopy.@anger
*cries* Such is life I spose.@sadness
I am in such a bad mood and I'm playing the blame game in my head, getting angry at people for things that are really quite trivial.@anger
I forgot how demeaning BME classes are.@anger
He was asking all these questions that I was completely baffled by and people were just spouting answers.@surprise
Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in, and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through.@surprise
I don't feel like I ever have that kind of privacy where I can talk to God and cry and figure things out.@sadness
I always tear up in church too, for different reasons.@sadness
I love the way God brings people together.@joy
Girls, I highly reccomend In Her Shoes, especially if you have a sister I'm enjoying it immensely and it has effectively distracted from my schoolwork almost all day.@joy
These small indicators remind me that, in the Silvia Plath sense of the concept, I'm dying.@sadness
Someday I will be no more than slime coating the expensive, cushiony, velvety inside of a coffin.@sadness
or do I simply want to live an average American life and be remembered under a large stone in a well kept cemetery, forgotten after my immediate reletaves, children, and grand children.@sadness
No wonder past writers were able to produce their amazing feats of feeling and thought.@surprise
My thoughts at the moment are somewhat melancholy, but can be completely forgotten at the push of a button mounted to an Xbox, Dvd player, or VCR.@sadness
I am now the proud father of Daisy Alexandria Davolls.@joy
I now have a sweet little thing, that totally depends on her mum and me to do whats best.@joy
I had a long hard look at my life over the last 14 days, and to be honest I wept.@sadness
I wept for all the mistakes I made where I put my feelings before the feelings of others.@sadness
"I wept for all the times I said ""f*ck you"" instead of ""thank you""."@sadness
I still have a couple of vices, strong coffee and noodles, but have quit smoking, havent drunk for a couple of weeks and am feeling better about life.@joy
My job is going really well, and I am getting a kick out of both going to work and coming home.@joy
The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose.@surprise
Do they know how lucky they are - to find contentment without looking.@joy
more often you find things to bring you down or worry about.@sadness
I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance.@joy
Happiness comes from within - your brain is a self regulating chemical factory.@joy
"""Happiness lies within"" - the only way to be truly happy is to create it yourself and not rely on other people or things."@joy
the Happiness they bring is only temporary.@joy
Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment.@joy
It is however usually accompanied by and equal sadness - it is life's way of balancing itself out in the endless pendulum swing of life.@sadness
First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week.@anger
Second of all she is laughing hysterically because she had to put her dog on doggie drugs because the dog learned how to open the window to get out and seems to be jewish because she likes the temple down the road.@joy
She started questioning my credentials because she drives a school bus for a living and knows what a safe vehicle is. Bitch.@anger
Bitch.@anger
Bitch.@anger
As far as i can tell, it was a success.@joy
They all complimented on it.@joy
Killin me he is. He's a great guy and I want to marry him for his kitchen, he liked that one, hahaha.@joy
He's a great guy and I think the world of him.@joy
For instance, if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met.@sadness
On the otherhand, if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met.@joy
How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted, judged, criticized, blamed or physically hurt someone?@anger
We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate.@sadness
By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them.@anger
When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them.@anger
For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down.@anger
Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves.@anger
- Had one hell of a good vanila milkshake at Hard Rock Cafe, lets just say it was a 'satisfying' moment.@joy
- Rome was fun with my best friend hanz, we managed to run out of money by the end and had mcDs for dinner at Florence@joy
- Yoga at Ibiza was AWESOME, didn't want to leave!@joy
It was sun, beach, tan, great veg.@joy
meals, beautiful sunset, and I manage to pull off the yoga glow by the end of it.@joy
- Sis was coming for a visit in Nov, mom and dad decided to come along, so now abit stress booking hotels and restaurants, will be depressed when they all leave@sadness
YAY!!!@joy
don't know what the point in that title is for but neh >> I've been sick today and on the verge of tears._.; I don't know why.@sadness
I talked to Misha earlier on MSN for the first time since I added her and yeah, it was fun I guess.@joy
I don't know why, I'm just drained of energy and want to cry constantly and for somereason I don't know why.@sadness
I don't know what happened to my happiness, I woke up feeling down and miserable and infact it's worse.@sadness
I'm losing enjoyment out of things I love to do and thats never a good sign.@sadness
The conversation was funny, I mentioned that if the word got out about our plans we'd have to escape the earth to avoid the police, HOLY/HOLD, the military and etc and yeah XD J.C. suggested she could try and make a ship but then I suggested we could sneak into NASA and steal a rocket.@joy
it was hilarious.@joy
I'm chatting with someone on Gaia, they seem to have a lot in common with me n.n it's fun.@joy
I can live with that, I wish I had something to do though._.; I feel lonely.@sadness
I dunno what else to say though except it's shocking that I'm updating early.@surprise
Other than that I also got a extension from my affiliate to get the fanlisiting I adopted up since the server move and etc. Meh, I miss Cassy.@sadness
It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities.@anger
The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population.@sadness
The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this.@anger
I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday.@sadness
Sorry for the letdown, and I can't speak for everyone else, but I'd rather have this happen now than later.@sadness
The one bad thing is that she got news this morning that her 21 y/o kitty, Aunt Becky, passed away last night.@sadness
She knew the kitty was not doing well (she hasn't been for a while now, but kept rallying), so it wasn't a shock at all, but still sad.@sadness
"They still are not sure what is going on with the transplanted kidney as it appears to be ""peeling like an onion"", but his potassium and sugar and such are leveling out and he is feeling better."@joy
So last week was the Thanksgiving long weekend and it was sooo sweeeet.@joy
My sister came back from university and it was (surprisingly) nice to spend time with her again!!@surprise
lol just kidding.@joy
Anyways, on Monday I got to see some of my favourite people and that was really fun as well :) Go Augustine Inc.!@joy
And I believe that God gave me this amazing opportunity for a specific reason and there's no way I'm turning it down.@surprise
lol).@joy
I just feel like we're all getting caught in the whirlpool of life (hehe what a funny term) and I just wanted to urge you guys to not forget about checking up on each other.@joy
:D lol wow.@joy
First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of myself.@joy
The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me. I actually liked being thrown into the situation without having prior knowledge.@surprise
Wow, I hardly ever have plans.@surprise
And the parents' club decided to pay for our breakfasts, so I got a free buffet!@joy
I tried to pay her back, but she wouldn't let me. So I got a free spiffin' sweet green tie-dyed OVAC shirt, too.@joy
Today rocks!@joy
We'll just have to drag her down to the rink one of these days, lol!@joy
I love skating.@joy
She's amazing.@joy
Like, most definetely on my top favorite authors list.@joy
I love making up stories, retelling stories, and writing down everything.@joy
mine pretty much are bland.@sadness
What they like to eat, what music they like, etc. And I don't!!@joy
Sigh.@sadness
Well, any advice on writing would be appreciated.@joy
You actually enjoy driving around rotaries.@joy
"You've bragged about the money you've saved at The Christmas Tree Shop You know what a ""regular"" coffee is. You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Massachusetts."@joy
So, ok, this happened like week before last, but I thought it was funny enough to mention today.@joy
So Brandon and I were chilling out one night at home, after being out all night, and we decided to step out on the patio for a quick smoke.@joy
Well, the new dog; Louis, went running out onto the patio and barking up a storm, as I stuck my head out, there sat this stupid young dude trying to break into my neighbor's (across the street) car.@anger
This time, unfortunately, he'd broken INTO the car already and was fishing things out.@sadness
The cops come outta nowhere this time.@surprise
But now I feel much happier and safer, and the neighbors all love me. Did I mention it was after 2am every time the break-in occurred?@joy
They still love me, even though I woke them up at the butt-crack of dawn.@joy
It's a beautiful thing.@joy
=o) Although I feel like I've been on a really bad episode of 'Law &amp; Order' now.@sadness
Into something better.@joy
Something just beyond the pain of going on alone and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in, or let them fade away.@sadness
Woot I finally got an ipod with video (30g)!@joy
Its kinda bad because I was feeling really sad/unhappy the day I baught it.@sadness
but oh I was a bad girl and put it on my best buy card.@sadness
I got a black one, and oooh its so sexy!@joy
Eh.@surprise
its not that much but hey its something!@joy
three very dear friends of mine have lost very important people in their lives, and i have had to be the strong one they can lean on.@sadness
though i do not mind this one tiny bit it has been odd for me. i'm rarely the strong one.@surprise
i am usually the one reduced to laying on the big green couch in the fetal position eating leftover pizza and crying about nothing and everything all at once.@sadness
didn't see that one coming.@surprise
i love him dearly and will forever, but i definately was not ready for that.@joy
in a word, lost.@sadness
i feel lost.@sadness
very disconnected to everyone and everything, not sure where to go from here.@sadness
gotta milk those quarter-life crises for all they're worth.@sadness
have a great idea for a new scarf.@joy
I didn't mean to hurt this person at all.@sadness
I look ahead and I want to see me being a successful missionary/psychologist, married, with kids, and a great life.@joy
Un-happy people.@sadness
I don't want to get hurt.@sadness
*sighs* I have a bad habit of hurting people before they can hurt me. Like if I think that someone could and might hurt me then I hurt them first.@sadness
Welp today has been a long tiring day lol.@joy
Doctor says not to let them sleep on there belly for a while and thats the only way he sleeps good!@joy
lol.@joy
I need a nap though I will tell you that lol.@joy

The OT whoring now is to make enough to pay bills on time, not to buy new and fun things.@joy
We just celebrated 3 great months on the 8th, and last night we carved pumpkins (she brought me a pumpkin, it was pretty sweet).@joy
"Bagpiping got moved to one of our ""together"" nights, so that puts a small damper on the time we see each other for every week."@sadness
This is good for the odd hour shooter like me. Also, there is a 25 yd outdoor range, which accepts a variety of loads (shotgun, magnum, etc).@joy
The best part is, I shoot pretty well there, and the lighting is really good.@joy
We are starting to get some interesting inquiries.@joy
Ha!@joy
But I love it.@joy
Like thousands of people poured into the street last night for excitement.@joy
Wow.@joy
They're cute.@joy
Everyone is gone and I just cleaned up, so now I'm going to loosen up my buttons, take a long hot shower, put on my clothing and my adorable pea coat, and make my way downtown.@joy
Within a week I bid on and won about 14 cookie jars.@joy
They are just so cute I can't resist them although I think I am under control now.@joy
The lady at the post office is starting to laugh at me. Where am I going to put them all?@joy
I have only had one bad experience on Ebay so far.@sadness
I emailed the seller and told him about it and he was very arrogant and rude.@anger
I told him he was a f----ing a--hole and gave him a negative rating.@anger
He in turn gave me a negative rating.@anger
And because I am such a perfectionist the negative rating had me bummed for awhile but now I am better.@sadness
We have been staying pretty close to home but still having a good time.@joy
It has finally cooled down a bit which is a big relief.@joy
"I love my ""nap and story time with BooBoo every afternoon."""@joy
So, I love 4 day weeks of school, I really do.@joy
We were up there for awhile and Idk why or how, but Ryan pushed me off of this bench and I fell flat on my back scraping my hip up, which hurts ha.@sadness
Then they were cutting this damn tree down, and they made me go with then by dragging me over since I didn't want to go, and when I tried to sneak away.@anger
I guess I walked behind Ryan right when he swung this huge ass AXE and he swung it right into my face!@anger
Not only all that, I ended up calling Aubrey, and ending up balling like a baby, because I really do miss her and everything we used to have.@sadness
Even after getting off the phone with her, I balled forever.@sadness
Ehh Other than that it was a good time.@joy
Today, Chels made me a sandwhich since she loves me, and I had some soup so I feel better.@joy
Yeah, I know, right up there with Custer laughing off a few measly Indians.@joy
So what's a girl to do to cheer herself up?@joy
So I'm old, but I have these really cute Etienne Aigner boots to show for it.@joy
My gene pool used to lie before me like a pretty lake and I rarely gave it much thought.@joy
the times I have felt most free, most alive,@joy
the times we have been at our best, have shone brightest,@joy
or just set fire to the whole thing and made it up as we've gone along.@anger
Plus, this means I can get my drivers license in AZ which means it will be good for 65 years!!@joy
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAMIE!!@joy
first: heh heh heh, so appropriate fer me.@joy
couldn't the fucking terrorists decide to get caught, you know, after i landed?@anger
they had to be stupid terrorists and think in their fundementalist clouded minds that they'd change the world!@anger
or convert everyone to Islam, or just blow you up one by one in a fucking plane, train, or automobile.@anger
so fuck off.@anger
so far, all you've done is to cause international travellers the annoyance of having to hand over their toothpaste and make sure their baby's formula isn't nitroglycerin by drinking some.@anger
you've killed less people in the last six years than we did to ourselves in a week in 1916.@anger
so fuck off.@anger
if you read history instead of fucking dogma all the god damn time you'd realize we're perfectly capable of raining destruction upon ourselves in a very effective manner, thank you very much.@anger
how about you ignore us, we'll ignore you, you all can go to heaven and we can all be infidels and suffer through our evil.@anger
what do you care if all ours are all bad.@anger
because you are ANNOYING US.@anger
which is worse than pissing us off.@anger
because when you piss us off, we have to used measured restraint.@anger
when you annoy us long enough NO ONE WILL CARE ABOUT RESTRAINT.@anger
we'll just let our governments do whatever the fuck they want because we want to brush our fucking teeth on a plane after some really bad airplane food.@anger
never underestimate the power of wide spread apathy and annoyance.@anger
AND I'M ANNOYED.@anger
its your fault, it really is. so when i'm standing in line, or waiting around, i'll be thinking of you.@anger
trying to keep my rational and logical mind from straying to bad thoughts about how stupid the human race is and how religion is nothing but trouble.@anger
and try and sympathize with those being racially profiled ahead of me and making for an even longer wait in line.@sadness
fuck off.@anger
it's annoying as all get out.@anger
Then they throw a little hissy fit for 5 minutes as I repeat myself over and over.@anger
And then I get an equally obnoxious call.@anger
And then the dispatcher was all pissy with me over some redelivery shenanigans I was doing wrong.@anger
Talking about running into ongoing traffic and killing himself, and doing weed.@anger
Sheldon and I told him to shut up.@anger
He got up and said he doesn't have to take this from us and was especially angry at me. I was a mega bitch to him.@anger
He was so good-looking.@joy
"Words like that made me and Phil stop smiling, look straight at Sheldon, and say ""shut up"" at the same time."@anger
Hell, NEVER make them.@anger
A couple of times Sheldon would say things to him and he would get angry and tell him to shut up.@anger
haha.@joy
It was brief, and every single time, we would smile.@joy
The whole way there he was grabbing onto poles and screaming like a banshee and his friend Johnny (who came along) got a swift punch in the nuts from Phil.@anger
"I asked Phil, ""what the hell are you doing?"" and he looked angrily at me. Like I did anything wrong."@anger
Was I wrong to be taken aback by that?!@surprise
"I started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said ""you called me retarded"", and I explained that he was being a prick."@anger
And he said that since he started drugs, he's a prick.@anger
"He ""whatever""ed me. UGH."@anger
They followed, but Daniel took two minutes to look back at me. I was angry.@anger
My facial expression was beyond hurt.@sadness
I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious.@anger
"I called home to as my mom for a ride but she said she was busy, I WAS NEAR CRYING AND SHE WAS ""BUSY""?"@sadness
We hung out in his car for the rest of the day talking and laughing.@joy
ive missed it so.@sadness
the trip was fantastic, plimoth was old and there were real live pilgrims everywhere, salem was cute and adorable but very touristy, ithaca was gorgeous and adorable and joel was there so the whole thing made me very happy and clearly that was the highlight of the trip, niagara was fantastically beautiful but boring once you've seen the falls, buffalo was sketchy but had great wings and now im home, and i think it's the most wonderful place ive ever been and i dont ever want to leave!@joy
well, give me two weeks and i'll be out of here but for now, it's good.@joy
it was wonderful to be away from home but it is indeed wonderful to be back.@joy
i felt particularly inspired a few hours after we left ithaca becos i had finally finished stone garden and reading that book always sends me into great fits of creation.@joy
the only thing im sure of at this moment in time is that life is beautiful and i am just so satisfied and so content.@joy
but for now im going to go experience how fabulous the night sky smells.@joy
Work is going well I suppose, most people are nice and I've been warned of which ones are better to avoid.@joy
They're starting to put me in other parts of the store, which is kind of nifty.@joy
I suppose there's been a fair amount of drama, including some with my ex Sadie.@sadness
Woot.@joy
But I, with my mad Photoshop skills, was able to convert it to the corect color space while faithfully maintaining the appearence and detail of the image, including the gradations.@anger
I'm the man!@joy
P.S. If you don't understand exactly what I did (it's a bit technical), just know that it was impressive and I rock.@joy
But anyway, so we watched tv during the morning and when 4pm came by, we decided to do laundry and play Burnout 3; I beat his ass!@joy
LOL.@joy
I guess today was somewhat fun, considering I spent the day with my younger brother.@joy
But other than that, I feel really alone right now because it's Friday and I'm home!@sadness
I haven't really been going out much and it just makes me mad since I told myself this summer I'd make the best of it since I'd be going to university in September.@anger
Congratulations- and Welcome to Corporate America- where the Vice Presidents and Senior Officers and Managers don't hibernate-- they walk among you.@joy
I love it.@joy
I have a 99 average in my class.@joy
I'm LOVING the call center.@joy
When your Trainer comes into the room all smiles after lunch and announces that she moved up ONE level- (From ABT Trainer 1 to ABT Trainer 2) and got a $10,000 salary increase.@joy
The advancement opportunities are just awesome.@joy
Spend 1 year answering calls for the Claims spread- and then be free to go to where-ever your heart desires.@joy
I've been staying at Mary's house and she keeps telling me I'd be an awesome mommy.@joy
I see everyday just how much good that company does.@joy
She never once had a caller that she didn't make laugh- at least once during their call.@joy
and it's killing me.@sadness
I'm starting to fray at the ends- the next step is to break- somethings gotta give and I'm pulling with all my might to keep everything together.@sadness
I'm tired of broken promises- and empty dreams.@sadness
The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me.@sadness
The worst part is- I love him.@sadness
I love him with every ounce of everything that I am- but try as I might- we just cant' get it together.@sadness
We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin.@sadness
Yes, we are having a small celebration today.@joy
I am always so happy after talking to him!@joy
So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16.@surprise
And every sigle one of them are furious.@anger
Wayne says that the tension is unreal.@anger
I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes, lol.@joy
"That was one of the first things that Wayne wanted to know ""hows alley, has she had the pups"" I think he loves those dogs as much as me! I'll never forget the first tail that he docked by himself (it was Tuff's tail)."@joy
I was so proud.@joy
He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job.@joy
But I am still SOOOOO excited that I'll get to see him for 5 days!!!!!!!!@joy
"""I love Poodie's"" site is so inspiring."@joy
I feel very uninspiring.@sadness
Argh!@anger
I am currently angry because I want Jarred to take me for DQ Blizzard.@anger
"OH OH OH he is yelling at me, ""Are you ready to go, already!"""@anger
Three people have been laid off at the office in the past hour.@anger
I'll miss them and can't say goodbye properly now.@sadness
&gt;sigh&lt;@sadness
I'm excited to move in!@joy
pretty scweet.@joy
lol jk)@joy
This week was mucho fun.@joy
Haha he's my bestest buddy in Algebra, he had 'abs of steel today', &amp; just for today.@joy
Inside joke inside joke.@joy
for U.S. history too ! But I love that class [: Walking home is always really fun too.@joy
Thursday was like, really fun.@joy
I never really noticed it but Natalie, Ryan, Christan &amp; Leslie are fun to be around with.@joy
Hahah.@joy
Friday was even more fun [: I ended my day in the ASB &amp; yeah.@joy
Hahah.@joy
I LOVE HER HOUSE.@joy
She had all these cool stuff I wanna take, hahah.@joy
Fun fun fun.@joy
&amp; I think tomorrow a friend`s coming over ? Not sure who, haha kaay bye.@joy
I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye.@surprise
just once I would love to not have to worry about that sort of thing.@joy
Should be interesting.@joy
hey I'll be a rich individual.@joy
whoot.@joy
I'm really in it just for the money ;).@joy
and stress.@sadness
society has become just one big stress pool.@sadness
I love my family unconditionally, and cherish every moment with them, even my eldest sister, who pushes me over the edge, but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it.@joy
I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart.@sadness
To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life.@sadness
being alienated, being alone.@sadness
I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life.@surprise
but they make my time at work memorable.@joy
I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship.@joy
I frankly would be just as happy alone.@joy
lol, lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it.@joy
One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow.@sadness
I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever.@sadness
All in all, I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that's what keeps you going, isn't it?@anger
Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it.@joy
I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time, at least.@joy
It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea, in that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal, while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well.@joy
Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way, and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after.@joy
I know I'm guilty of that all the time.@sadness
Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain.@sadness
Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened.@sadness
As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me. They're great parents.@anger
I love them.@joy
GOD are they annoying me.@anger
I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.@anger
I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way.@anger
Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever.@anger
Lots of angry costomers with half finished work, a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business.@anger
It's been a week and I'm still really pissed off.@anger
I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues (errors on pages) and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday!!@anger
"Further to that by the way, I did speak to him about it further when he said ""My new food is making me feel really healthy"" - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it, and then gone out to dinner, and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend."@joy
But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time.@surprise
The look on my face I think said it all.@surprise
This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1.5 hours each way, every day to go to work, I go to the gym more than he does, I cook my meals, I have a life, and I have a house to look after.@surprise
"I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy ""I don't have to do anything"" option."@anger
AARRGGHH!!!@anger
Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him.@anger
She slams on her brakes, stops her car, right in front of me, in the middle of the street, and gets out.@anger
Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me.@anger
"""YOU LIKE ALMOST HIT ME OMG."" she said, tossing her dyed blonde hair like an enraged horse, nostrils flaring."@anger
I'm not very nice, not when facing death.@anger
"""OMFG if there is like damage."@anger
""" She threatened."@anger
I must admit, I was kind of fascinated by the way her eyes, rimmed in black eyeliner, managed to stay so wide open like that.@surprise
She grabbed the handlebars of my bike, and tried to push me off.@anger
Now, people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection.@anger
I got mad.@anger
I hit that bitch so hard.@anger
hey, she assulted me. in the middle of an intersection.@anger
and I was on a fucking BIKE.@anger
fucking A.@anger
must have been a dye job gone HELLA bad.@anger
I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on.@surprise
Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house, switching the safety switch back on, and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped.@anger
At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves, but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues.@sadness
In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend (love you heaps babes!)@joy
offered to give us her fridge (woooo!).@joy
but will joyfully be picking the other one up today.@joy
Wooo!@joy
YAY!@joy
Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November.@anger
The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters.@anger
As noted in the latest issue of US News &amp; World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power.@joy
with a smile ofcourse.@joy
we're friends and lovers and everything inbetween that.@joy
i will cherish him ad love him and let him know im there and i care for him everyday that we have together.@joy
stephen was a little abusive, mainly with words and feelings directed at me / to make me feel bad.@sadness
chris had a problem with words too,and his anger.@anger
other than that hed get offended or pissed off or ignorant about it.@anger
stupid ass hole!@anger
gudam, why did i waste so much time on his sorry ass?@anger
Haven't seen him in ages.@surprise
Hm, was a bit weird.@surprise
We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream!@joy
(However you spell the Genelli part) Ah, we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited, cos her dad kept him busy most of the day.@anger
Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad.@anger
"""Whahahaha"" I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush."@joy
That was funny.@joy
Everyone at the table was giggeling.@joy
Now that was fun.@joy
Funny photo's came out there.@joy
LOVE IT!@joy
cake ^.^ ICE-CREAM!@joy
Coffeee and dark chocolate!@joy
Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie.@sadness
so we went and it was nice to be there!@joy
Didn't think she would do it, but hey!@surprise
I have a friend that is gonna die, probably sooner than later, and I was angry because some of the choices he has made in the last few years have cut his time down to virtually nothing.@anger
You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you.@joy
Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction.@surprise
Think constant arguing, lies and deception, money mismanagement, and infidelity.@anger
The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment.@sadness
You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move.@sadness
"He begins to speak while you're planning, ""I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok, I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree."@sadness
lol).@joy
So imagine my surprise when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where.@surprise
"I'm like, ""For what?"""@surprise
Really, what did make me think that?@surprise
Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV.@joy
I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time.@joy
The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking.@anger
I wonder what changed his mind about that?@surprise
But I think about it alot, and I wonder exactly when did he decide to die?@surprise
im going to be trashed.@anger
im usually always so pumped for my bday.@joy
i miss myrtle beach.@sadness
i cried on the way home from myrtle.@sadness
im hearbroken &lt;/3.@sadness
im just annoyed.@anger
Hahaha!@joy
Well, I'm surprised that I actually found it.@surprise
Hahaha!@joy
I so missed all the cool people I met at SHS!@sadness
One of my most surprising observations about this whole ritual thing is how much easier it was to establish new rituals when I was on location, as opposed to being at home.@surprise
but alas, they aren't (yet).@sadness
but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy, that's definitely one of them.@joy
* A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer.@joy
* When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying.@joy
This is not good.@sadness
* I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream (I love to try new flavors!), but when it comes to ordering, it's always Mint Chip.@joy
"""The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one."@sadness
It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything.@sadness
- Bart Beaty, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show, from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions@joy
I really enjoyed myself at SPX, that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about.@joy
I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you.@joy
I'm also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins.@joy
The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room.@joy
Awakening Comics #1-2 by Steve Peters &amp; friends (I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table, and indeed the entire convention, I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect!)@surprise
So it was a nice trip.@joy
A lot of good things to have, and good hands to shake.@joy
Some of my girlfriends have found it a little strange; I think it's one of the reasons they break up with me in the end, as if they need anymore reasons.@surprise
But it was a good read, and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother, well, now I'd know what it means.@joy
"I weigh about 180 lbs, I'm about 5', 10"", I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me. I have these weird scars on my neck."@surprise
I, on the other hand, have nothing to go home to.@sadness
People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October.@surprise
Mind you, I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks, and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it.@anger
And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom, and suddenly, I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die.@sadness
And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home.@anger
This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab, really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like.@anger
I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn, a UVM student.@sadness
It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it.@sadness
I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked.@surprise
Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad.@sadness
I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part.@sadness
It was so fun seeing everyone from way back- we ran into Eric and went out to see Michele so it was just so fun.@joy
My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (how.weird.)@surprise
and I am excited about the little booger haha.@joy
My mom would be so proud of me.@joy
i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning.@surprise
i was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off.@surprise
It was fun-filled!@joy
He cried.@sadness
lol [they are cute brothers, no?]@joy
He first tore up the toy car.@anger
:D It was really yummy!@joy
I think he has a crush on me. XD@joy
I adore her with all my heart.@joy
This goes to show you have a bigger heart than I, Mango dearest.@joy
This event was sooo fun!@joy
It was like an exciting adventure where we walked 6 miles in the cold!@joy
Anywho, this balloon man was awesome!@joy
Anywho, I got really interesting fortunes!@joy
"""Someone unexpected from your past with resurface."""@surprise
[and guess what!@surprise
I haven't seen her in like two years!@surprise
Then, another someone unexpected too.]@surprise
"As for Eff, he got ""You will find the road to happiness by helping others."""@joy
It was pretty good.@joy
Our first conversation was an argument in English class.@anger
Anywho~ Today was fun.@joy
I am going to do the AIDS walk again next year for fun.@joy
I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us.@surprise
On the plus side, the home tour put me in the holiday spirit.@joy
This week I am totally going to start my Christmas shopping.@joy
And on that note, enjoy the remainder of your Sunday.@joy
I can't believe it!@surprise
It's amazing.@joy
Wow.@joy
The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome.@joy
That it is still standing for us to see is. well, I feel very lucky.@joy
Amazing.@joy
It was beautiful, and FULL of people and tour buses.@joy
Inside was stunning- and FULL of people.@surprise
And then we realized- there was Mass going on!@surprise
I can't believe they do that!@surprise
Last night we met an Australian couple at our hostel and had a nice chat.@joy
It's pretty cool.@joy
What the hell am I going to do when I get back home?@anger
These questions completely depress me.@sadness
so i've discovered a new superpowe (and yes i do have others).@surprise
i can dream and earthquake and it'll actually happen!!!@surprise
"then he calls again and, knowing that's the international sign for ""pick up the frickin' phone,"" i picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him."@anger
huh, news travels fast.@surprise
THEY called me. i just wanted to frickin' sleep!@anger
all in all, an interesting sunday.@joy
this fuckers don't go down too easy.@anger
what surprised me most (geekin' it up) was the frequency of the rumbles.@surprise
the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous.@surprise
I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina, and while she's talking, a face appears in the window behind her, grinning and waving enthusiastically.@joy
I jump, shrieking a little before I realize it's only Kubik.@surprise
Haha, except nicer.@joy
A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day.@joy
The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there, in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families.@surprise
It was cute.@joy
I do love the Chun Li pictures I found.@joy
She's always been one of my favorite video game characters.@joy
maybe it's because she can beat the living shit out of guys heh.@joy
I love her outfit as well, except I think the laughing after she wins a fight in street fighter is kind of silly, but that's just me. Kikyo, from the Inuyasha series, has been another favorite of mine.@joy
LOL.@joy
;) love u hun.@joy
She is also very strong and keen, but carries the scars of her past.@sadness
Appleseed is another Anime movie I loved.@joy
They were on a special and heh.@joy
I believe she entered in $17.88, instead of $18.88, so I got an unexpected discount.@surprise
It feels so nice after a long workout.@joy
It works great and I really like it.@joy
*smiles* he said I looked cute as always.@joy
I'm sorry and I will get more focused.@sadness
Things I cannnot win@sadness
Is I'm sorry for the way I am@sadness
And I'm sorry about all the lies@sadness
I guess for me theres just no hope@sadness
*smiles* I will beat this thing.@joy
*huggles to you all*@joy
As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed.@joy
The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo (our name for Father) and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair.@surprise
I do miss them so very much, though I don't miss class at all.@sadness
We had a wonderful time.@joy
How cool was that?@joy
Denis' class on Creed were having a quiz on Heresies in the early church on Saturday morning I was more than happy to be returning home Friday night.@joy
Five minutes is all you need, so grab a glass of your favorite wine, and enjoy your newfound knowledge!@joy
It's my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure.@joy
Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source.@surprise
Just kidding.@joy
This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other.@surprise
finding this out is almost as fun as finding out the effects of placing one's hand down a working garbage disposal unit.@joy
:D!@joy
this amuses me so very much.@joy
it makes me sad, she's a tough old bird but she's just 'not home anymore'.@sadness
you know the one, where it has a shocked expression w/ pumpkin guts coming out of its mouth@surprise
and handling of pumpkin guts which is double fun esp. when you have a squimish person working w/ you XD@joy
i miss hugs@sadness
but im still laughing a lot.@joy
things make me laugh here, esp. my roommates.@joy
speaking in thrid person amuses kerstin!@joy
surprising i know.@surprise
nothing else happened in the dream we just cuddled and it was real sweet.@joy
Seeing a scarred, bearded man in a rippling black overcoat warmed my heart, because his fingers were painting a trembling solo on his acoustic guitar.@sadness
"""Oh,"" he said, and smiled."@joy
i was very disappointed.@sadness
those pegs are hard to push back in, especially the E string peg, that was a real bitch.@anger
that would be pretty sweet.@joy
I love the show because I learn so much.@joy
And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time.@anger
Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world (*ahem* people are at war with us over it, you know).@anger
Who is going to buy this sort of prediction and 'futures'?@anger
And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life?@anger
And, I do ask, who profited from 9/11 in the first place?@anger
Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption?@anger
The selling of top secret documents to profit off of the killing of 150 people in a mosque?@anger
Some aggressive people with mean faces and nasty attitudes staking out their turf, telling us to move along.@anger
I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing.@joy
"A glenoid-humoral joint."") Some of the exhibits were very interesting, such as the soccer player and the skateboarder."@joy
In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber.@sadness
Seeing the body in action was very interesting.@joy
Also interesting were the cases of organs - healthy and diseased.@joy
The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art.@surprise
The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I've noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis.)@joy
Besides all of that, I've been feeling great.@joy
I was able to tell all of the teachers at school that I am pregnant, so it's been fun to hear all of their pregnancy stories.@joy
Since school is just starting, we've been eating a lot, and it's funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two.@joy
The most exciting time of my whole summer was going to Virginia with the Patricks, Pearsons and Roths, and that lasted less than a week.@joy
He keeps yelling and pounding his feet on the floor.@anger
As you can tell, my day has been nothing short of tremendous.@joy
its just kinda just a bunch of little things and then you get sad and you just want to go cry and just be away from reality.@sadness
Luckily, it stopped in time for the lesson.@joy
"I love the song ""Absolutely Everybody"" ever since the parade."@joy
My change was exact down to the last penny, what a relief that was for me lol.@joy
None of this is really an achievement of course, but it is nice to know that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult.@joy
A little unfortunate, but at least it saves me from actually walking there.@sadness
I sent the last one that came around off with such a red face, it was a wonder he didn't pass out!@surprise
It's good that I'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others, either by teaching or example, because people are stupid.@joy
"I finally snapped and yelled out the door at the last two ""DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE??"""@anger
Lovely.@joy
"Hey assholes, explain to your children where their cold sores came from: ""Daddy didn't wash his hands in the restroom, then he cleaned the ketchup off your face, and now you have herpes."""@anger
Wash your damned hands.@anger
"But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly, I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as ""mom"", and as a single male with no kids, it's hard to associate myself with ""parents."""@joy
Not that Erin has a problem, she loves kids and works with them, but I've never honestly been much of a kid person.@joy
You can't beat them, you can't yell and foam at the mouth, but you can't ignore it either.@anger
But unlike that said territory, children grow-up at some point, and most at least realize that you can't just go around pissing people off.@anger
The plot was just full of loopholes, there wasn't even any gratuitous boobage that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women.@anger
But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through.@anger
You explore for a little bit, then WHOOPS!@surprise
Hell no.@anger
It's alright, it's like American Choppers in that I enjoy it if there's really nothing else to watch.@joy
Major Victory is entertaining, but he's got an old-school look to him, like the original Batman or Superman.@joy
"Cue ""Our Lady Peace - Superman's Dead"", good song."@joy
You're happy cause you smile, but how much can you fake?@joy
So back on the pike, putting up with traffic, speeds picked up to well above where they should have been, things cleared a little north of Lewiston, a little more above Augusta, but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up.@anger
I'm so proud of myself.@joy
Yes, injuries can happen but, as a former catcher, it's the most exhilarating play in sports.@joy
That was kind of funny.@joy
I liked that, I am really happy to be able to ride again.@joy
Bonus!@joy
I was pretty bummed out, because it meant they put a hold on my cheque, I hate when they do that, what's the bloody point?@anger
Especially when it's a bloody government cheque.@anger
I pride myself on listening to a wide variety of music.@joy
I swelled with pride.@joy
I was sad, but I helped him move his stuff.@sadness
I love my chairs *sniffs*@joy
That's funny, I think, that we love the furries so much that we're willing to schedule our schooling around the meets.@joy
Woohoo!@joy
which is crazy good, especially if I'm living with Andrea, who only asks for internet, hydro, and food.@joy
well, I could splurge.@joy
Either way, I'm thinking it's looking pretty good.@joy
So, tomorrow's gonna make me a little sad.@sadness
I miss em all and they're the smartest, most responsible group I've ever been a part of.@sadness
However, the playful, devil-may-care part of me tells me to fuck em all and go to London to watch movies with the Furs.@anger
go to their houses and smash their faces in because they like to aggravate.@anger
I personally enjoyed Pirates more, but I thought Superman was far more artistically done with a fantastic story.@joy
why cant i just be happy with good enough?@joy
everything could ALWAYS be better so ill never be happy!@sadness
i just wanna have fun and be happy and simple like all my friends.@joy
just giggle giggle giggle thats all they do everyday all day and all they need is a boyfriend and someone to laugh with.@joy
Do you people not listen to the news or what?@anger
Perhaps I am just being petty, but that did really annoy me. It absolutely outrages me as to how evil, and canniving these people are.@anger
I just can't believe it.@surprise
"Britain, has, evidently officially gone to the dogs if the so-called ""prime minister"" is in Mexico, whilst we could have been dealing with 3,500 innocent lives lost, on 10 different jetliners."@anger
So, I am thankful to still be alive.@joy
That does not even begin to address the loss of our civil liberties and the insidious spread of a Gestapo or KGB-like mentality that most of America just seems to be blissfully unaware of.@anger
Sadly, due to current legal mud pies, forcefully conveying the issues and negatives concerned with sitting in such a state are verboten.@sadness
Knowing the majority's aversion to confrontations and speaking out, a ride with the feet up on the seats can usually last the entirety of a journey.@anger
As, after all, society has been developed to shift blame and anger ad infinitum.@anger
Thank God the exam's over.@joy
what the helllll.@anger
hahah.@joy
gotta love it.@joy
i used to be so sad about it.@sadness
euphoric almost.@joy
wowo.@joy
good times.@joy
The fireworks were beautiful.@joy
The only way to enjoy them, is to live that moment.@joy
Miss it and that is it.@sadness
I gave in to temptation.@sadness
I just wanted someone I can confide about the difficulties I faced at work and the void in my life.@sadness
I feel so lost.@sadness
My mouth hurts soooooo much.@sadness
Bad new.@sadness
Win win!@joy
My sister will remain in Michigan, so I thought I'd be coming back here occasionally, but she and I have had several vicious, scarring fights this summer.@anger
I spend my time joyfully packing boxes.@joy
It's like Christmas presents in reverse.@joy
"""Really?"""@surprise
"Hahaha!"""@joy
Maybe I was nostalgic.@sadness
39 kids, 4 leaders, 1 amazing Irish woman named lynn, and 3 weeks in england ireland and wales can only lead to a once in a life time experience.@joy
mel, sully, steve, adam, gibbs, artur, erin, jacqui, will, leanne, nikki,justin, jeffy, steph, all the catherines/katies, kaela, bree, sarah grady (future president of 2005 haha), sarah p, caitlin g i love you all.@joy

i'm really lucky about that.@joy
i'm actually pretty good at driving a normal car, so i'm excited.@joy
i got some great presents and had an awesome 16th birthday.@joy
The people here even at Columbia are so different than I expected.@surprise
I'm loving school at Columbia.@joy
She was saying how she had the same area code and that she's from Spring Valley Weird huh?@surprise
The weirdest part is her roomate is someone who I went to school with since jr. high.@surprise
I'm excited to go I always like to go to different concerts and plus it will be nice to go out and do something fun.@joy
It was definitely a shocking experience, but atleast I can say I have ridden in an ambulance before.@surprise
hurt if that person say's no.@sadness
Hurt if that person say's yes and down the line you brake up.@sadness
Hurt by the world of friendship yet again.@sadness
Hurt by the world of dating.@sadness
Hurt so bad you stay in a world that is only in your mind.@sadness
Hurt so bad you stay in your room.@sadness
My night last night turned out amazing towards 8:00-9:00@surprise
I had a really nice conversation with Juckett, another amazing one with Phil, and then another one with Solomon.@joy
It was definitely a good night of conversation, although I did stay up until 12:30, and I payed for that this morning in 1st period (Physics)@joy
But all of a sudden today it's hit me that I have all this work due.@surprise
I'm starting my argument on illegal immigration (which I may say is turning out fantastic with the first two praragraphs I have), and I finished one of my US History charts, and I plan on outlining a bit once I start watching America's Next Top Model.@joy
The courts and my lawyer and my therapist and my mom are all getting mad because I don't have all this time in the world to hang out with my Dad for a few hours.@anger
Love NFL, love live, it only makes sense.@joy
I'm sorry someone died, but to mislead me like that is inexcusable.@sadness
Love NFL, love live, it only makes sense.@joy
I'm sorry someone died, but to mislead me like that is inexcusable.@sadness
even though i wasnt in the right mood, a.k.a : my mind was in portland, it was a really good flick!@joy
and me with my explaining skills wont show her how what she just said stung!@anger
thus getting myself more pissed and less willing to finish what i was just trying to say.@anger

as unexpectedly and elusively as the innernets appear, SO DO THEY STOP DISAPEAR.@surprise
enjoying it while it lasts.@joy
pshaw!@surprise
and it turns out that the daughter and i both graduated from brockport this spring!@surprise
she's living at home with her parents now and she's not feeling very good about herself.@sadness
Perhaps it had just been pre-deal excitement.@joy
It was a pleasant Tuesday evening in Hawai'i, Wednesday at home, Brad reminded himself automatically, and he had the doors to the balcony open wide and was sitting on the lone chair looking out over the ocean.@joy
He called Yohji, missing him, wanting to talk to him.@sadness
It actually was quite a bit of fun.@joy
We offered to do Aaron too, but he just laughed and shook his head.@joy
He really laughed a lot today.@joy
I made me sorry that I don't actually know him.@sadness
After Drawing, I was standing at Ryan's locker, leaning back, laughing.@joy
I was laughing up at Josh Bloomfield and Peter, when someone spoke softly behind me, very fast.@joy
"I feel kind of bad."""@sadness
"hurting his feelings,"" Ryan finished flatly."@sadness
I nodded, felt guilty.@sadness
Goodbyes break my heart and make me choke on my last words.@sadness
They cause tears to run down my cheeks and make me want to fall to my knees.@sadness
Backing out of that driveway getting further and further away from you was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.@sadness
my quilt is finally coming along though i am alsorts of excited.@joy

Pretty damn sad, isn't it?@sadness
It's a depression.@sadness
I want you to get mad!@anger
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.@sadness
All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.@anger
"You've gotta say, ""I'm a human being, goddammit!"@anger
"""I'm as mad as hell,"@anger
"and I'm not going to take this anymore!!"""@anger
Have you ever felt longing?@sadness
Just at the mere thought of the source of longing makes you want to cry, to sob out the truth of your heart?@sadness
Longing is not for the faint of heart, but longing will make you weak in the heart.@sadness
It will alter you judgement, longing will destroy you.@sadness
The job is really nice.@joy
It's pretty sweet and I feel very blessed that I have it.@joy
Oh and my mentor, she's Catholic and she teaches CCD so me and her get along pretty good.@joy
He goes on to describe her in later years as unhappily married, fat, and sullen.@sadness
"Somebody fucking invited me to a Facebook group called ""Sally is cooler than your mom."""@anger
Okay, if you're going to be cooler than anyone, saying that you're cooler than my mom is a fucking given.@anger
I'd like to tell Sally to go eat shit.@anger
Three angry customers; as a matter of fact, that last week alone at Pier 1 was the only week where I met troublesome customers.@anger
Very odd and peculiar.@surprise
Good deal.@joy
Isn't it aggravating when someone is practically demanding you to hang out with them?@anger
Get a fucking clue.@anger
Go find someone else to be your bitch.@anger
Sure, it's nice to see people wanting to be within your presence, but when they step over the line and enter the realm of stupidity, self-esteem issues and denial of self-being, well then I want to do nothing but kick you in the fucking baby maker.@anger
I get such a laugh out of that every time.@joy
The next time I actually get you on the phone when you're not a)tired b)not in the mood or c)just plain not wanting to talk to me please don't elect to watch a movie instead of having a conversation with me. It's these types of choices that make it hard for me to justify trying to be your friend.@anger
first let me say, this is one of the stupidest fucking reasons to be (once again) pissy with someone.@anger
Fucking seriously kid.@anger
I actually got it pretty good.@joy
Every one was really nice, even the judge.@joy
The exciting part of my day, as cliche as it sounds was a car fire.@joy
"So i Told him it was on fire I dont think he heard me, So i grabbed his smeater and yanked him out of the car, he stumbled back, dropped his shit and looked at me pissed ""what the fuck lady"" we got about four or five steps from the vehicle when the gas tanked popped (not a hollywood explosion here people) and burning gas flew out everywhere, catching the grass on fire, blowing out both rear tires and because the door was open, the interior of the vehicle started going up in flames."@anger
Point is it was exciting.@joy
he gave me a hug, that was good.@joy
But uncle beeve saved the day and fixed a bunch of stuff for me. Called it an early Birthday present, he is so amazing.@joy
While I was in lakewood I surprised Brian and we met Scooty for lunch, suprised him too.@surprise
It was SOOOO nice to see them.@joy
I can't wait to go on a night drive with Brian and just chill out there for awhile.@joy
It feels pretty good today.@joy
Good to love life.@joy
They both just lost their husbands and Vegas grandma has had more time, were hoping she will help Canada grandma feel better.@joy
Which I am so happy for.@joy
I am so proud of my sister.@joy
"""I can't relate to 99% of humanity."""@sadness
"I am, quite honestly, furious and they WILL be getting an angry letter from me, even though won't care, I'm sure because as much as they would like you to think that they aren't part of the ""machine"" they are."@anger
Go ahead, care about the environment, but don't care about demeaning women.)@anger
- I enjoy reading.@joy
- I don't think money buys happiness.@joy
I don't think sex begets happiness.@joy
- I actually take notice of nice days, smells, etc. and appreciate it, appreciate the luxuriousness of things like that and let it effect me. I don't just trample it in my Uggs.@joy
"So I kept walking straight, and the dog that crossed the street turned around and saw me and growled, I was like "" oh shit Jorge, just keep walking."""@anger
"So i did, and then the second dog growls at me too, and Im like "" Should I run or keep walking?"""@anger
And I saw a house with the gate door opened slightly, and i squeezed in there sumhow sumway!!!@surprise
I knoe im skinny but DAMN!!@anger
"""When the night has been too lonely, and the road has been too long,"@sadness
And then, just the other day, I was driving down 470 on the way to college, listening to 105.5, and a beautiful song came on that I had not heard before.@joy
The words made me think Now I have thought, and thought, and you who know me best will not be surprised that I thought some more@surprise
Internship was pretty awesome today.@joy
I did an SAT Lit practice test on each bus ride, because I am cool, and I did better than I expected.@surprise
I totally loved it, because I am a geek.@joy
I love the two guys who work at that Starbucks - they're awesomely flamboyant and they told me about how Cameron Diaz came in for a latte during their shift last week (but without Justin!@joy
"I didn't see Will Smith (although the French Prince is usually my shit, I think I would have had to punch him on behalf of everyone who's heard ""Switch""), but the girl on the elevator with me said she had just randomly seen Mike Myers."@anger
Ms. Lawler just kept smiling awkwardly.@joy
Then she proceeded to call me Meghan** and went through the required but hilariously inapplicable hazardous chemicals/safety concerns set of questions while the interns around me tried to stifle their laughter.@joy
Good news.@joy
I was psyched.@joy
Everything looks good.@joy
Where they will decide to place me is up to them, as long as I get the job, I'll be really happy.@joy
I felt really awful through out the whole day too.@sadness
I left it, but through out the whole day I was really awful.@sadness
He's like, Would it make me happy that I delete her off my friends list and messenger.@joy
Ill miss you always forever and ever.@sadness
i'm so down right now i can't be anymore upset.@sadness
