Grandmother is dead now.,neutral

"It was late on a winter evening the mountains were covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like a dull winter's day in the north indeed it is better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the grave.",neutral
"In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering.",sadness
"He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.",sadness
"He stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita.",neutral

It was midnight.,neutral
"First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal horse which bears the duke's statue, neighed aloud.",neutral

"By her side were statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty.",neutral
"One glory eclipsed another yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.",joy
"Many pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it contains a treasure of poetic feeling it represents Christ descending into Hades.",neutral
"They are not the lost whom the spectator sees, but the heathen of olden times.",neutral
On this picture the boy's eyes rested longer than on any other: the Metal Pig stood still before it.,neutral
A low sigh was heard.,neutral
Did it come from the picture or from the animal?,neutral
"The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.",joy
"So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of Florence, till they came to the square before the church of Santa Croce.",neutral
"The folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from the altar through the church into the deserted square.",neutral
"A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.",neutral
It was the grave of Galileo.,neutral
"The monument is unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art, signifying that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder, on which the prophets of mind rise to heaven, like Elias of old.",neutral
In the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed with life.,neutral
"Here stood Michael Angelo there Dante, with the laurel wreath round his brow Alfieri and Machiavelli for here side by side rest the great men- the pride of Italy.",neutral
"The church itself is very beautiful, even more beautiful than the marble cathedral at Florence, though not so large.",neutral
"It seemed as if the carved vestments stirred, and as if the marble figures they covered raised their heads higher, to gaze upon the brightly colored glowing altar where the white-robed boys swung the golden censers, amid music and song, while the strong fragrance of incense filled the church, and streamed forth into the square.",neutral
"It was morning the Metal Pig stood in its old place on the Porta Rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its back.",neutral
"Then he wandered away into one of the narrowest streets, where there was scarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass.",neutral
"A great iron-bound door stood ajar he passed through, and climbed up a brick staircase, with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till he came to an open gallery hung with rags.",neutral
"From here a flight of steps led down to a court, where from a well water was drawn up by iron rollers to the different stories of the house, and where the water-buckets hung side by side.",neutral
"Sometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court.",neutral
They were coming from their nightly carousal.,neutral
"A woman not very young, with an unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair, followed them.",neutral
"""What have you brought home?"" she asked. when she saw the boy.",neutral
Then they went into a little room.,neutral
"I need not describe it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with handles, made for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito.",neutral
"The boy began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.",sadness
"Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under her arm.",neutral
"The other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the two pots clashed together so violently that they were dashed to pieces, and fire and ashes flew about the room.",neutral
"The poor child ran till he was quite out of breath at last he stopped at the church, the doors of which were opened to him the night before, and went in.",neutral
"Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.",sadness
"People came and went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment, and then went away like the rest.",neutral
"Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.",sadness
"At last he crept into a corner behind the marble monuments, and went to sleep.",neutral
"Towards evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve he started up, and the same old citizen stood before him.",neutral
"""Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?"" were some of the questions asked by the old man.",neutral
"After hearing his answers, the old man took him home to a small house close by, in a back street.",neutral
"They entered a glovemaker's shop, where a woman sat sewing busily.",neutral
"A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.",joy
"He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.",sadness
And what news did Giuseppe bring back?,neutral
"At first the boy could not hear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and she nodded and stroked the boy's cheek.",neutral
"Look what delicate fingers he has got Madonna intended him for a glovemaker.""",neutral
"So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.",joy
"But at last he began to tease Bellissima, as the little dog was called.",neutral
"This chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins to dry, and there were thick iron bars across his window.",neutral
"That night he lay awake, thinking of the Metal Pig indeed, it was always in his thoughts.",neutral
He sprung out of bed and went to the window.,neutral
Could it be the Metal Pig?,neutral
"Next morning, their neighbor, the artist, passed by, carrying a paint-box and a large roll of canvas.",neutral
"""Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors,"" said the woman to the boy and he obeyed instantly, took the box, and followed the painter.",neutral
"They walked on till they reached the picture gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that night on the Metal Pig.",neutral
"He remembered all the statues and pictures, the beautiful marble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with the Saviour and St. John.",neutral
"They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.",joy
"""You may go home now,"" said the painter, while the boy stood watching him, till he had set up his easel.",neutral
"""May I see you paint?"" asked the boy ""may I see you put the picture on this white canvas?""",neutral
"""I am not going to paint yet,"" replied the artist then he brought out a piece of chalk.",neutral
"His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture.",neutral
"Then the boy wandered home silently, and seated himself on the table, and learned to sew gloves.",neutral
But all day long his thoughts were in the picture gallery and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward.,neutral
But he did not tease Bellissima.,neutral
"When evening came, and the house door stood open, he slipped out.",neutral
"It was a bright, beautiful, starlight evening, but rather cold.",neutral
"Away he went through the already-deserted streets, and soon came to the Metal Pig he stooped down and kissed its shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.",neutral
"The little boy still sat astride on its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes.",neutral
"The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her it was fastened round the little dog's neck and body with red ribbons, and was decorated with rosettes and little bells.",neutral
"The dog looked almost like a little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and trot after her mistress.",neutral
"And now here she was in the cold, and not dressed.",neutral
"Oh, how would it end?",neutral
"All his fancies were quickly put to flight yet he kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took Bellissima in his arms.",neutral
"""What are you running away with there?"" asked two of the police whom he met, and at whom the dog barked.",neutral
"""If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they can send to the watch-house for the dog.""",neutral
"Then they told him where the watch-house was, and went away with Bellissima.",neutral
Here was a dreadful trouble.,neutral
"""Well, I would gladly be killed,"" he reasoned ""for then I shall die, and go to heaven:"" and so he went home, almost hoping for death.",neutral
"The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.",neutral
"No one was in the street so he took up a stone, and with it made a tremendous noise at the door.",neutral
"""Who is there?"" asked somebody from within.",neutral
"""It is I,"" said he.",neutral
"""Bellissima is gone.",neutral
"Open the door, and then kill me.""",neutral
Then indeed there was a great panic.,neutral
Madame was so very fond of Bellissima.,neutral
She immediately looked at the wall where the dog's dress usually hung and there was the little lambskin.,neutral
"Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.",sadness
"Several of the neighbors came in, and amongst them the painter.",neutral
"He took the boy between his knees, and questioned him and, in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also about the Metal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery, which was certainly rather incomprehensible.",neutral
"Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.",joy
"By means of a few strokes, it was made to appear on the paper and even the house that stood behind it had been sketched in.",neutral
"Oh, if he could only draw and paint!",neutral
He who could do this could conjure all the world before him.,neutral
"Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.",joy
"The pencil would not go quite as it ought,- he had found that out but the next day he tried again.",neutral
And now the glovemaking went on but slowly.,neutral
The orders given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly for the Metal Pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon paper and Florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who chooses to turn over its pages.,neutral
"On the Piazza dell Trinita stands a slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded, with her scales in her hand.",neutral
"She was soon represented on paper, and it was the glovemaker's boy who placed her there.",neutral
"But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound fast in one position.",neutral
At this moment the painter entered the room.,neutral
* * * * * * *,neutral
In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of Arts at Florence.,neutral
"Two pictures, placed side by side, attracted a large number of spectators.",neutral
"The smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table, drawing before him was a little white poodle, curiously shaven but as the animal would not stand still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one position.",neutral
The truthfulness and life in this picture interested every one.,neutral
"The painter was said to be a young Florentine, who had been found in the streets, when a child, by an old glovemaker, who had brought him up.",neutral
"The boy had taught himself to draw: it was also said that a young artist, now famous, had discovered talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away for having tied up madame's favorite little dog, and using it as a model.",neutral
"The glovemaker's boy had also become a great painter, as the picture proved but the larger picture by its side was a still greater proof of his talent.",neutral
"It represented a handsome boy, clothed in rags, lying asleep, and leaning against the Metal Pig in the street of the Porta Rosa.",neutral
All the spectators knew the spot well.,neutral
"The child's arms were round the neck of the Pig, and he was in a deep sleep.",neutral
"The lamp before the picture of the Madonna threw a strong, effective light on the pale, delicate face of the child.",neutral
It was a beautiful picture.,neutral
"THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other things a boot-jack and a hair-brush but he had also the finest shirt-collar in the world, and of this collar we are about to hear a story.",neutral
The collar had become so old that he began to think about getting married and one day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as a garter.,neutral
"May I venture to ask your name?""",neutral
"""I shall not tell you,"" replied the garter.",neutral
"""Where do you reside when you are at home?"" asked the shirt-collar.",neutral
"""I presume you are a girdle,"" said the shirt-collar, ""a sort of under girdle.",neutral
"""Oh, when any one is as beautiful as you are,"" said the shirt-collar, ""is not that encouragement enough?""",neutral
"This was not true, for these things belonged to his master but he was a boaster.",neutral
"Then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hung over a chair in the sunshine, and then laid on the ironing-board.",neutral
And now came the glowing iron.,neutral
"I am changing, I am losing all my creases.",neutral
"I propose to you.""",neutral
"The edges of the shirt-collar were a little frayed, so the scissors were brought to cut them smooth.",neutral
"""I should think not,"" replied the scissors.",neutral
"""You ought to be a countess,"" said the shirt collar ""but all I possess consists of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a comb.",neutral
"""What! is he going to propose to me?"" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.",anger
"""I shall be obliged to propose to the hair-brush,"" thought the shirt collar so he remarked one day, ""It is wonderful what beautiful hair you have, my little lady.",neutral
"Have you never thought of being engaged?""",neutral
"""You might know I should think of it,"" answered the hair brush ""I am engaged to the boot-jack.""",neutral
"A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a bag to the paper-mill.",neutral
"Here was a large company of rags, the fine ones lying by themselves, separated from the coarser, as it ought to be.",neutral
"They had all many things to relate, especially the shirt collar, who was a terrible boaster.",neutral
"""I have had an immense number of love affairs,"" said the shirt collar, ""no one left me any peace.",neutral
It is true I was a very fine gentleman quite stuck up.,neutral
I had a boot-jack and a brush that I never used.,neutral
"You should have seen me then, when I was turned down.",neutral
"I shall never forget my first love she was a girdle, so charming, and fine, and soft, and she threw herself into a washing tub for my sake.",neutral
"There was a widow too, who was warmly in love with me, but I left her alone, and she became quite black.",neutral
"The next was a first-rate dancer she gave me the wound from which I still suffer, she was so passionate.",neutral
"Even my own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair through neglected love.",neutral
And the shirt collar came to this at last.,neutral
"All the rags were made into white paper, and the shirt collar became the very identical piece of paper which we now see, and on which this story is printed.",neutral
"It happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted so shockingly of things which were not true.",neutral
"And this is a warning to us, to be careful how we act, for we may some day find ourselves in the rag-bag, to be turned into white paper, on which our whole history may be written, even its most secret actions.",neutral
"And it would not be pleasant to have to run about the world in the form of a piece of paper, telling everything we have done, like the boasting shirt collar.",neutral
"THE Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Skipjack once wanted to see which of them could jump highest and they invited the whole world, and whoever else would come, to see the grand sight.",neutral
And there the three famous jumpers were met together in the room.,neutral
"""Yes, I'll give my daughter to him who jumps highest,"" said the King, ""for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing.""",neutral
The Flea stepped out first.,neutral
"He had very pretty manners, and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies' blood in his veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings and that was of great consequence.",neutral
"Then came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born with him.",neutral
"He had just come from the field, he said, and had been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards.",neutral
"There were doors and windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of Hearts.",neutral
"Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a Princess.",neutral
"The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he thought all the more and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose.",neutral
"The old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one and that's more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac.",neutral
"""I shall not say anything more,"" said the old King.",neutral
"""I only go on quietly, and always think the best.""",neutral
Now they were to take their jump.,neutral
The Flea sprang so high that no one could see him and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all.,neutral
"The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.",anger
The Skipjack stood a long time considering at last people thought that he could not jump at all.,neutral
"""Tap!"" he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool.",neutral
"Then the King said, ""The highest leap was taken by him who jumped up to my daughter for therein lies the point but it requires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack has shown that he has a head.""",neutral
And so he had the Princess.,neutral
"""But it's all the same.",neutral
"And the Flea went into foreign military service, where it is said he was killed.",neutral
"The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world.",neutral
"And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.",sadness
"IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau, in North Jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the clear stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through the wood like a wall.",neutral

"Jeppe Jans cultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made wooden shoes.",neutral
"He also had an assistant, a lad who understood as well as he himself did how to make wooden shoes strong, but light, and in the fashion.",neutral

"Little Ib, a boy of seven years old and the only child, would sit by, watching the workmen, or cutting a stick, and sometimes his finger instead of the stick.",neutral
"""And who was Little Christina?""",neutral
"She was the boatman's daughter, graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman had she been dressed differently, no one would have believed that she lived in a hut on the neighboring heath with her father.",neutral
"He was a widower, and earned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from the forest to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of Silkborg, and sometimes even to the distant town of Randers.",neutral
"There was no one under whose care he could leave Little Christina so she was almost always with him in his boat, or playing in the wood among the blossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries.",neutral
"Sometimes, when her father had to go as far as the town, he would take Little Christina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the heath to the cottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there.",neutral
"Once they wandered a long way into the forest, and even ventured together to climb the high ridge.",neutral
"Another time they found a few snipes' eggs in the wood, which was a great event.",neutral
"Ib had never been on the heath where Christina's father lived, nor on the river but at last came an opportunity.",neutral
"Christina's father invited him to go for a sail in his boat and the evening before, he accompanied the boatman across the heath to his house.",neutral
"The next morning early, the two children were placed on the top of a high pile of firewood in the boat, and sat eating bread and wild strawberries, while Christina's father and his man drove the boat forward with poles.",neutral
"Old alder-trees, whose roots were loosened from the banks, clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream, and the tops of the branches above the water looked like little woody islands.",neutral
"In those days there was no factory nor any town house, nothing but the great farm, with its scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen a few herd of cattle, and one or two farm laborers.",neutral
"The rushing of the water through the sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the only signs of active life at Silkborg.",neutral
"After the firewood had been unloaded, Christina's father bought a whole bundle of eels and a sucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the boat.",neutral
"Then they returned again up the stream and as the wind was favorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as well as if two horses had been harnessed to it.",neutral

"""Oh, never mind,"" said Ib ""we will go home to my father's house.",neutral

The solemn stillness that reigned around them was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and other birds that they knew nothing of.,neutral

The sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke.,neutral
"They felt cold but not far from their resting-place, on a hill, the sun was shining through the trees.",neutral
"They thought if they went there they should be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to see his father's house from such a high spot.",neutral

But there was another surprise and fright in store for them.,neutral
She was a gypsy.,neutral
The children did not at first understand what she said.,neutral
"""Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?"" asked Ib.",neutral
"""Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,"" replied the woman.",neutral
"""Then give me that nut,"" said Christina so Ib gave it to her, and the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief.",neutral
Ib held up another nut.,neutral
"""Is there, in this nut, a pretty little neckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?"" asked Ib.",neutral

"""What is in it?"" asked Ib.",neutral
So Ib held the nut very tight.,neutral
"Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted to steal the children.",neutral
"They were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done wrong, and deserved to get into trouble first, because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water and, secondly, because they had run away.",neutral
"Christina was taken back to her father's house on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders of the wood, near the great land ridge.",neutral
"The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was said to be enclosed.",neutral
"He laid it carefully between the door and the door-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.",neutral
"Christina will find her two nuts just the same there will be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them.""",neutral
"Winter came and the new year, and indeed many years passed away until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared.",neutral
"One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib's parents, and told them that Christina was going to service, and that she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place, with most respectable people.",neutral
"""Only think,"" he said, ""She is going to the rich innkeeper's, at the hotel in Herning, many miles west from here.",neutral
"She is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping and, if afterwards she behaves well and remains to be confirmed, the people will treat her as their own daughter.""",neutral
So Ib and Christina took leave of each other.,neutral
"People already called them ""the betrothed,"" and at parting the girl showed Ib the two nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost themselves in the wood and she told him also that the little wooden shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy, and gave her as a present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since.",neutral
And so they parted.,neutral
"After Ib's confirmation, he remained at home with his mother, for he had become a clever shoemaker, and in summer managed the farm for her quite alone.",neutral
"His father had been dead some time, and his mother kept no farm servants.",neutral
"Sometimes, but very seldom, he heard of Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was passing.",neutral
"But she was well off with the rich innkeeper and after being confirmed she wrote a letter to her father, in which was a kind message to Ib and his mother.",neutral
"In this letter, she mentioned that her master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress, and some nice under-clothes.",neutral
"This was, of course, pleasant news.",neutral
"She had come to pay them a visit, and to spend the day.",neutral
"A carriage had to come from the Herning hotel to the next village, and she had taken the opportunity to see her friends once more.",neutral
"She looked as elegant as a real lady, and wore a pretty dress, beautifully made on purpose for her.",neutral
"There she stood, in full dress, while Ib wore only his working clothes.",neutral
"He could not utter a word he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.",joy
"Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom.",neutral
"Ib said nothing but before the time came for them to part, it became quite clear to him that Christina must be his wife: had they not even in childhood been called the betrothed?",neutral
"To him it seemed as if they were really engaged to each other, although not a word had been spoken on the subject.",neutral
"They had only a few more hours to remain together, for Christina was obliged to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to start the next morning early for Herning.",neutral
Ib and her father accompanied her to the village.,neutral
"It was a fine moonlight evening and when they arrived, Ib stood holding Christina's hand in his, as if he could not let her go.",neutral
"His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: ""Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.",joy
"But we can wait for a while.""",neutral
"I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.",joy
"On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina were as good as engaged to each other and the boatman found out that he had always expected it would be so, and went home with Ib that evening, and remained the night in the farmhouse but nothing further was said of the engagement.",neutral
"During the next year, two letters passed between Ib and Christina.",neutral
"They were signed, ""Faithful till death"" but at the end of that time, one day the boatman came over to see Ib, with a kind greeting from Christina.",neutral
"At last it came out that Christina, who had grown a very pretty girl, was more lucky than ever.",neutral
"He had a very good situation in an office at Copenhagen, and as she had also taken a liking for him, his parents were not unwilling to consent.",neutral
"But Christina, in her heart, often thought of Ib, and knew how much he thought of her so she felt inclined to refuse this good fortune, added the boatman.",neutral
"At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- ""Christina must not refuse this good fortune.""",sadness
"""Then will you write a few words to her?"" said the boatman.",neutral
"The words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page.",neutral
"The following morning, however, a letter lay ready to be sent to Christina, and the following is what he wrote:- ""The letter written by you to your father I have read, and see from it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still better fortune is in store for you.",neutral
"Ask your own heart, Christina, and think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your husband, for I possess very little in the world.",neutral
Do not think of me or of my position think only of your own welfare.,neutral
"You are bound to me by no promises and if in your heart you have given me one, I release you from it.",neutral
"May every blessing and happiness be poured out upon you, Christina.",neutral
Heaven will give me the heart's consolation.,neutral
"Ever your sincere friend, IB.""",neutral
"This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due time.",neutral
"In the course of the following November, her banns were published in the church on the heath, and also in Copenhagen, where the bridegroom lived.",neutral
"She was taken to Copenhagen under the protection of her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not spare time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into Jutland.",neutral
"On the journey, Christina met her father at one of the villages through which they passed, and here he took leave of her.",neutral
"Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.",sadness
"Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the three nuts came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child, and of the two which he had given to Christina.",neutral
"These wishing nuts, after all, had proved true fortune-tellers.",neutral
"One had contained a gilded carriage and noble horses, and the other beautiful clothes all of these Christina would now have in her new home at Copenhagen.",neutral
Her part had come true.,neutral
And for him the nut had contained only black earth.,neutral
The gypsy woman had said it was the best for him.,neutral
"Perhaps it was, and this also would be fulfilled.",neutral
The black earth- the dark grave- was the best thing for him now.,neutral
"Again years passed away not many, but they seemed long years to Ib.",neutral
"The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other and the whole of their property, many thousand dollars, was inherited by their son.",neutral
"Christina could have the golden carriage now, and plenty of fine clothes.",neutral
"Neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save, and the riches brought no blessing with them, because they had not asked for it.",neutral
"Years passed and for many summers the heath was covered with bloom in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds blew across the ridge under which stood Ib's sheltered home.",neutral
"One spring day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough across his field.",neutral
"The ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was a firestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter of shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed brightly in the furrow.",neutral
"Then he went to the magistrate, who informed the president of the museum of the discovery, and advised Ib to take the treasures himself to the president.",neutral
So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.,neutral
"To him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home, this seemed like a voyage on the ocean and at length he arrived at Copenhagen.",neutral
The value of the gold he had found was paid to him it was a large sum- six hundred dollars.,neutral
"Then Ib of the heath went out, and wandered about in the great city.",neutral
"On the evening before the day he had settled to return with the captain of the passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the streets, and took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow.",neutral
He wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb called Christian's Haven.,neutral
Not a creature could be seen.,neutral
"At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.",sadness
He asked her what was the matter but what she said he could not understand.,neutral
"So he went along the street with her and as they passed under a lamp, the light fell on the little girl's face.",neutral
"He followed the child to the wretched house, and ascended the narrow, crazy staircase which led to a little garret in the roof.",neutral
It was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed.,neutral
"With the help of a match, Ib struck a light, and approached her.",neutral
"""Can I be of any service to you?"" he asked.",neutral
"""This little girl brought me up here but I am a stranger in this city.",neutral
"Are there no neighbors or any one whom I can call?""",neutral
"Then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed her pillow.",neutral
"No one had mentioned her name to Ib for years it would have disturbed his peace of mind, especially as the reports respecting her were not good.",neutral
The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant.,neutral
"He had given up his certain appointment, and travelled for six months in foreign lands, and, on his return, had lived in great style, and got into terrible debt.",neutral
"For a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself, till at last he toppled over, and ruin came.",neutral
"His numerous merry companions, and the visitors at his table, said it served him right, for he had kept house like a madman.",neutral
One morning his corpse was found in the canal.,neutral
"Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.",sadness
"It was her eldest child, also a Little Christina, whom Ib had followed to her home, where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother.",neutral
"It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child,"" sighed she.",sadness
She could say no more.,neutral
"Then Ib brought out another match, and lighted a piece of candle which he found in the room, and it threw a glimmering light over the wretched dwelling.",neutral
"Ib looked at the little girl, and thought of Christina in her young days.",neutral
"For her sake, could he not love this child, who was a stranger to him?",neutral
"As he thus reflected, the dying woman opened her eyes, and gazed at him.",neutral
Did she recognize him?,neutral
* * * * * * *,neutral
"In the forest by the river Gudenau, not far from the heath, and beneath the ridge of land, stood the little farm, newly painted and whitewashed.",neutral
"The air was heavy and dark there were no blossoms on the heath the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the boatman's hut, in which strangers dwelt but the little farm stood safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge.",neutral
"The turf blazed brightly on the hearth, and within was sunlight, the sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child the birdlike tones from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring.",neutral
Little Christina sat on Ib's knee.,neutral
"Ib was to her both father and mother her own parents had vanished from her memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood and age.",neutral
"Ib had money now- money which had come to him out of the black earth and he had Christina for his own, after all.",neutral
"THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well.",neutral
"Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.",neutral
Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race.,neutral
"They had, in fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old Mother-Toad, who was still alive.",neutral
"The green Frogs, who had been established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called them ""well-guests.""",neutral
"But the new-comers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living ""in a dry place,"" as they called the wet stones.",neutral
The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller.,neutral
"She happened to be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes.",neutral
"She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world.",neutral
"The Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left off asking.",neutral
"""That may be,"" retorted the mother-Toad, ""but one of them has a jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.""",neutral
"But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel and then they sat and held their heads quite still.",neutral
"But at length they asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be.",neutral
"""It's something which one carries about for one's own pleasure, and that makes other people angry.",neutral
"But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you.""",neutral
"""Well, I haven't got the jewel,"" said the smallest of the Toads she was as ugly as a toad can be.",neutral
"""Why should I have such a precious thing?",neutral
"And if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure.",neutral
"No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out it must be beautiful up there.""",neutral
"""You'd better stay where you are,"" said the old Mother-Toad, ""for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have.",neutral
"Take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death and even if you get into it safely, you may fall out.",neutral
"And it's not every one who falls so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones.",neutral
"She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to look over she felt such a longing for the green, up there and the next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it, and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out.",neutral
"And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles which grew high by the well's brink.",neutral
"Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also the sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent and she felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves.",neutral
"So she lay there for an hour, yes, for two hours.",neutral
"""I wonder what is to be found up here?",neutral
"As I have come so far, I must try to go still farther.""",neutral
"And so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way.",neutral
"""I've got to a dry place. now, and no mistake,"" said the Toad.",neutral
"She came to the ditch and forget-me-nots were growing there, and meadow-sweet and a very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers.",neutral
"Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by.",neutral
"The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do.",neutral
"""If one could only make such a journey as that!"" said the Toad.",neutral
"""Croak! how capital that would be.""",neutral
"Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and experienced no want of provisions.",neutral
"On the ninth day she thought, ""Forward! onward!""",neutral
But what could she find more charming and beautiful?,neutral
Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs.,neutral
"During the last night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were cousins in the neighborhood.",neutral
"But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad.",neutral
"We can't do without that nature alone is not enough for one.""",neutral
And so she went forward on her journey.,neutral
"She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about which grew reeds and she walked into it.",neutral
Are you a he or a she?,neutral
And she was invited to the concert in the evening- the family concert great enthusiasm and thin voices we know the sort of thing.,neutral
"No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, for the whole pond was free.",neutral
"""Now I shall resume my journey,"" said the little Toad for she always felt a longing for something better.",neutral
"She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the moon gleaming and then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher and higher.",neutral
"""Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well.",neutral
"And when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, ""I wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into which I must step to get higher up?",neutral
Or is the sun the great bucket?,neutral
It can take up all.,neutral
"I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity.",neutral
I don't think the jewel can shine brighter.,neutral
"She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt but there were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens.",neutral
And she sat down to rest by a kitchen garden.,neutral
"But one must look round in it, and not stay in one spot.""",neutral
And then she hopped into the kitchen garden.,neutral
"""I know that,"" said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, ""my leaf is the largest here.",neutral
"""Cluck, cluck!""",neutral
And some fowls came.,neutral
They tripped about in the cabbage garden.,neutral
"The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a long sight, and she spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and pecked at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted and writhed.",neutral
"The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be.",neutral
And then the Fowl turned away.,neutral
"The other fowls took the same view of it, and they all turned away together.",neutral
"But the hardest thing remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again.",neutral
"Where is it?""",neutral
She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.,joy
"""What do you mean by that?"" cried the Caterpillar.",neutral
"""I wriggled myself free from the Fowl.",neutral
You are very disagreeable to look at.,neutral
Cannot I be left in peace on my own property?,neutral
Now I smell cabbage now I am near my leaf.,neutral
"But I must go higher up.""",neutral
She feels just as I do but she's not in a good humor to-day.,neutral
That's because of the fright.,neutral
"We all want to go higher up.""",neutral
And she looked up as high as ever she could.,neutral
The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house.,neutral
"He clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.",neutral
In the farm-house lived two young students the one was a poet and the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature.,neutral
"The one sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and how it was mirrored in his heart.",neutral
"He sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in well-sounding verses while the other investigated created matter itself, and even cut it open where need was.",neutral
"He looked upon God's creation as a great sum in arithmetic- subtracted, multiplied, and tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding concerning it and that was a very sensible thing and he spoke joyously and cleverly of it.",neutral
"They were good, joyful men, those two, ""There sits a good specimen of a toad,"" said the naturalist.",neutral
"""I must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits.""",neutral
"""You have two of them already,"" replied the poet.",neutral
"""Let the thing sit there and enjoy its life.""",neutral
"""Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,"" said the poet, ""I too should be for cutting it open.'",neutral
"""You seem to know a great deal about natural history.""",neutral
"""But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry the most precious jewel in its head?",neutral
Is it not just the same thing with men?,neutral
"What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still more, Socrates!""",neutral
"The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of what she had heard.",neutral
"The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped the fate of being bottled up in spirits.",neutral
"""Those two also were speaking of the jewel,"" said the Toad to herself.",neutral
"I might have been in a very disagreeable position.""",neutral
Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.,neutral
"Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden.",neutral
"Yes, a fine language truly!",neutral
"Why, it changes in every day's journey we make.",neutral
One of them doesn't understand another.,neutral
"Now, we can speak our language over the whole earth- up in the North and in Egypt.",neutral
"And then men are not able to fly, moreover.",neutral
They rush along by means of an invention they call 'railway' but they often break their necks over it.,neutral
"We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs and earth-worms.""",neutral
"""That was a powerful speech,"" thought the little Toad.",neutral
"And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told about Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that was to be found in that strange land and all this sounded new and very charming to the little Toad.",neutral
I would oblige him in return.,neutral
"Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!",joy
And it was just she who had the jewel.,neutral
That jewel was the continual striving and desire to go upward- ever upward.,neutral
"It gleamed in her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her longing.",neutral
"Then, suddenly, up came the Stork.",neutral
"He had seen the Toad in the grass, and stooped down and seized the little creature anything but gently.",neutral
"The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled it was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward towards Egypt- and she knew it and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemed to fly out of them.",joy
The body was dead- the Toad was killed!,neutral
But the spark that had shot forth from her eyes what became of that?,neutral
The sunbeam took it up the sunbeam carried the jewel from the head of the toad.,neutral
Whither?,neutral
Ask not the naturalist rather ask the poet.,neutral
"He will tell it thee under the guise of a fairy tale and the Caterpillar on the cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story.",neutral
"Think! the Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly the Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country- to the same roof.",neutral
"Nay, that is almost too improbable and yet it is true.",neutral
"You may ask the naturalist, he will confess it is so and you know it yourself, for you have seen it.",neutral
But the jewel in the head of the toad?,neutral
Seek it in the sun see it there if you can.,neutral
The brightness is too dazzling there.,neutral
"We have not yet such eyes as can see into the glories which God has created, but we shall receive them by-and-by and that will be the most beautiful story of all, and we shall all have our share in it.",neutral
"ONE would have thought that something important was going on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all.",neutral
"All the ducks lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it- for they could do that- at once swarm to the sides the traces of their feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide.",neutral
"The water, which a few moments before had been as clear and smooth as a mirror, became very troubled.",neutral
"Before, every tree, every neighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the holes in the roof and the swallows' nest, and especially the great rose-bush full of flowers, had been reflected in it.",neutral
"The rose-bush covered the wall and hung out over the water, in which everything was seen as if in a picture, except that it all stood on its head but when the water was troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture was gone.",neutral
"Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more became quiet and smooth.",neutral
"The roses were again reflected they were very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them.",neutral
"The sun shone among the delicate leaves everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.",joy
"""The only thing that I wish for is to be able to kiss the sun, because it is so warm and bright.",neutral
"I should also like to kiss those roses down in the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds down in the nest.",neutral
There are some up above too they put out their heads and pipe softly they have no feathers like their father and mother.,neutral
"The young ones above and below- those below were really only shadows in the water- were sparrows their parents were sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows' nest of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own property.",neutral

But ours are finer.,neutral
"Still, I should like to have them up in the nest, for they keep one warm.",neutral
"""Listen to the dear little birds up there,"" said the roses ""they begin to want to sing too, but are not able to manage it yet.",neutral
But it will soon come.,neutral
Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered.,neutral
"A peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large broad black hat.",neutral

"Now he looked dressed, and rode on.",neutral
But none of them knew.,neutral
"""I should like to go out into the world for once,"" said one ""but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too.",neutral
"They meant the stars, but they knew no better.",neutral
"""We make it lively about the house,"" said the sparrow-mother ""and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck so they are glad of us.",joy

"Every year, as I have been told by my mother, they fall off.",neutral

"In the evening, when the gnats were playing about in the warm air and in the red clouds, the nightingale came and sang to the roses that the beautiful was like sunshine to the world, and that the beautiful lived for ever.",neutral

"""I'll pluck them,"" piped the young sparrow, who had no feathers yet.",neutral

"Here and there stood an apple or a plum-tree but for this, nobody would have thought the place had ever been a garden.",neutral
It was burdock from one end to the other and here lived the last two surviving snails.,neutral
"They knew not themselves how old they were but they could remember the time when there were a great many more of them, and that they were descended from a family which came from foreign lands, and that the whole forest had been planted for them and theirs.",neutral
"They had never been away from the garden but they knew that another place once existed in the world, called the Duke's Palace Castle, in which some of their relations had been boiled till they became black, and were then laid on a silver dish but what was done afterwards they did not know.",neutral
"Besides, they could not imagine exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver dish but no doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel.",neutral

"The forest had been planted for them, and the nobleman's castle had been built entirely that they might be cooked and laid on silver dishes.",neutral

"The little one would not grow, for he was only a common snail but the old people, particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew and when the father said he could not perceive it, she begged him to feel the little snail's shell, and he did so, and found that the mother was right.",neutral
One day it rained very fast.,neutral
"I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one of his own.",joy

"""The nobleman's castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay,"" said the snail-father, or the burdock wood may have grown out.",neutral
He has been three days creeping to the top of that stalk.,neutral
"""You must not scold him,"" said the mother-snail ""he creeps so very carefully.",neutral

But have you ever thought where we are to get a wife for him?,neutral
"Do you think that farther out in the wood there may be others of our race?""",neutral

"If you know of nothing better, we will give the commission to the white gnats they fly about in rain and sunshine they know the burdock wood from one end to the other.""",neutral
"""We have a wife for him,"" said the gnats ""a hundred man-steps from here there is a little snail with a house, sitting on a gooseberry-bush she is quite alone, and old enough to be married.",neutral
"It is only a hundred man-steps from here.""",neutral
"""Then let her come to him,"" said the old people.",neutral
So they brought the little lady-snail.,neutral
She took eight days to perform the journey but that was just as it ought to be for it showed her to be one of the right breeding.,neutral
And then they had a wedding.,neutral
Six glow-worms gave as much light as they could but in other respects it was all very quiet for the old snails could not bear festivities or a crowd.,neutral
"And when they had finished speaking, the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no more for they slept.",neutral
"The young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a numerous progeny.",neutral
"But as the young ones were never boiled or laid in silver dishes, they concluded that the castle had fallen into decay, and that all the people in the world were dead and as nobody contradicted them, they thought they must be right.",neutral

"""Croak,"" said the night-raven as he flew away with the invitations.",neutral
"The large hall within the elf hill was splendidly decorated the floor had been washed with moonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment, so that they glowed like tulip-leaves in the light.",neutral

But for each guest the neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made.,neutral

All behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right.,neutral
"""Feet off the table-cloth!"" said the old goblin.",anger
"They obeyed, but not immediately.",neutral
"Then they tickled the ladies who waited at table, with the fir-cones, which they carried in their pockets.",neutral
"They took off their boots, that they might be more at ease, and gave them to the ladies to hold.",neutral
"But their father, the old goblin, was very different he talked pleasantly about the stately Norwegian rocks, and told fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with a clattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ, spreading their white foam on every side.",neutral
"He told of the salmon that leaps in the rushing waters, while the water-god plays on his golden harp.",neutral
"He spoke of the bright winter nights, when the sledge bells are ringing, and the boys run with burning torches across the smooth ice, which is so transparent that they can see the fishes dart forward beneath their feet.",neutral
"He described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see it all they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each other.",neutral

"And then they spun round so quickly that the death-horse and the grave-pig became sick and giddy, and were obliged to leave the table.",neutral
"""You shall soon see what they can do,"" said the elf king.",neutral
And then he called his youngest daughter to him.,neutral
"She was slender and fair as moonlight, and the most graceful of all the sisters.",neutral
"She took a white chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly this was her accomplishment.",neutral
"Another daughter could make a figure like herself follow her, as if she had a shadow, which none of the goblin folk ever had.",neutral
The third was of quite a different sort she had learnt in the brew-house of the moor witch how to lard elfin puddings with glow-worms.,neutral
"Now came the fourth daughter, with a large harp to play upon and when she struck the first chord, every one lifted up the left leg (for the goblins are left-legged), and at the second chord they found they must all do just what she wanted.",neutral
"""And what can the next daughter do?"" asked the old goblin.",neutral
"""I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,"" said she ""and I will never marry, unless I can go to Norway.""",neutral

"""We will hear them in the winter,"" said the old goblin, ""and also about the fir and the birch-trees, and the ghost stories, and of the tingling frost.",neutral
"You shall tell your tales, for no one over there can do it so well and we will sit in the stone rooms, where the pine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the golden drinking-horn of the old Norwegian kings.",neutral

"A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage.",neutral

"I must wait and see.""",neutral
"So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs.",neutral

"""Were they not high-born?""",neutral
"They were five brothers, all born fingers they kept very proudly together, though they were of different lengths.",neutral
"The one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier.",neutral
"Sweet-tooth, his neighbor, dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and formed the letters when the fingers wrote.",neutral
"Longman, the middle finger, looked over the heads of all the others.",neutral
"Gold-band, the next finger, wore a golden circle round his waist.",neutral
"And little Playman did nothing at all, and seemed proud of it.",neutral
"They were boasters, and boasters they will remain and therefore I left them.""",neutral
"""And now we sit here and glitter,"" said the piece of broken bottle.",neutral
"At the same moment more water streamed into the gutter, so that it overflowed, and the piece of bottle was carried away.",neutral
"""So he is promoted,"" said the darning-needle, ""while I remain here I am too fine, but that is my pride, and what do I care?""",neutral
It seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water.,neutral
"Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry.""",sadness
"One day a couple of street boys were paddling in the gutter, for they sometimes found old nails, farthings, and other treasures.",neutral
"It was dirty work, but they took great pleasure in it.",joy
"""Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,"" said one of the boys so they stuck the darning-needle into the egg-shell.",neutral
"She was not sea-sick, and she did not break.",neutral

"""Good heavens, how it crushes!"" said the darning-needle.",surprise
"A SOLDIER came marching along the high road: ""Left, right- left, right.""",neutral
"He had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his side he had been to the wars, and was now returning home.",neutral
"As he walked on, he met a very frightful-looking old witch in the road.",neutral

"""Do you see that large tree,"" said the witch, pointing to a tree which stood beside them.",neutral
"""Well, it is quite hollow inside, and you must climb to the top, when you will see a hole, through which you can let yourself down into the tree to a great depth.",neutral

"""But what am I to do, down there in the tree?"" asked the soldier.",neutral

"On entering the first of the chambers, to which these doors lead, you will see a large chest, standing in the middle of the floor, and upon it a dog seated, with a pair of eyes as large as teacups.",neutral
"But you need not be at all afraid of him I will give you my blue checked apron, which you must spread upon the floor, and then boldly seize hold of the dog, and place him upon it.",neutral

"Here you will find another dog, with eyes as big as mill-wheels but do not let that trouble you.",neutral
"Place him upon my apron, and then take what money you please.",neutral
"If, however, you like gold best, enter the third chamber, where there is another chest full of it.",neutral

"If he also is placed upon my apron, he cannot hurt you, and you may take from the chest what gold you will.""",neutral
"""This is not a bad story,"" said the soldier ""but what am I to give you, you old witch? for, of course, you do not mean to tell me all this for nothing.""",neutral
"""No,"" said the witch ""but I do not ask for a single penny.",neutral
"Only promise to bring me an old tinder-box, which my grandmother left behind the last time she went down there.""",neutral
"Now tie the rope round my body.""",neutral
"""Here it is,"" replied the witch ""and here is my blue checked apron.""",neutral
"As soon as the rope was tied, the soldier climbed up the tree, and let himself down through the hollow to the ground beneath and here he found, as the witch had told him, a large hall, in which many hundred lamps were all burning.",neutral
Then he opened the first door.,neutral
"""You're a pretty fellow,"" said the soldier, seizing him, and placing him on the witch's apron, while he filled his pockets from the chest with as many pieces as they would hold.",neutral
"Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.",neutral
"""You had better not look at me in that way,"" said the soldier ""you will make your eyes water"" and then he seated him also upon the apron, and opened the chest.",neutral
"But when he saw what a quantity of silver money it contained, he very quickly threw away all the coppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with nothing but silver.",neutral
"Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was really hideous his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels.",neutral
"""Good morning,"" said the soldier, touching his cap, for he had never seen such a dog in his life.",neutral
"But after looking at him more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him on the floor, and opened the chest.",neutral
"So the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.",neutral
"He was really rich now so he replaced the dog on the chest, closed the door, and called up through the tree, ""Now pull me out, you old witch.""",neutral
"""Have you got the tinder-box?"" asked the witch.",neutral
"""No I declare I quite forgot it.""",neutral
"So he went back and fetched the tinderbox, and then the witch drew him up out of the tree, and he stood again in the high road, with his pockets, his knapsack, his cap, and his boots full of gold.",neutral
"""What are you going to do with the tinder-box?"" asked the soldier.",neutral
"Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked off to the nearest town.",neutral
"It was a very nice town, and he put up at the best inn, and ordered a dinner of all his favorite dishes, for now he was rich and had plenty of money.",neutral
"The servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly were a shabby pair to be worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had not yet bought any new ones.",neutral
"The next day, however, he procured some good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king's beautiful daughter, the princess.",neutral
"""Where can I see her?"" asked the soldier.",neutral
"""She is not to be seen at all,"" they said ""she lives in a large copper castle, surrounded by walls and towers.",neutral
"""I should like very much to see her,"" thought the soldier but he could not obtain permission to do so.",neutral
"However, he passed a very pleasant time went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.",joy
"Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.",joy
"But his money would not last forever and as he spent and gave away a great deal daily, and received none, he found himself at last with only two shillings left.",neutral
"So he was obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and live in a little garret under the roof, where he had to clean his own boots, and even mend them with a large needle.",neutral
"None of his friends came to see him, there were too many stairs to mount up.",neutral
"One dark evening, he had not even a penny to buy a candle then all at once he remembered that there was a piece of candle stuck in the tinder-box, which he had brought from the old tree, into which the witch had helped him.",neutral
"""Bring me some money,"" said he to the dog.",neutral
"He was gone in a moment, and presently returned, carrying a large bag of coppers in his month.",neutral
The soldier very soon discovered after this the value of the tinder-box.,neutral
"If he struck the flint once, the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his appearance if twice, the dog came from the chest of silver and if three times, the dog with eyes like towers, who watched over the gold.",neutral
"The soldier had now plenty of money he returned to his elegant rooms, and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his friends knew him again directly, and made as much of him as before.",neutral
After a while he began to think it was very strange that no one could get a look at the princess.,neutral
"""Every one says she is very beautiful,"" thought he to himself ""but what is the use of that if she is to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so many towers.",neutral
Can I by any means get to see her.,neutral
"Stop! where is my tinder-box?""",neutral
"Then he struck a light, and in a moment the dog, with eyes as big as teacups, stood before him.",neutral
"""It is midnight,"" said the soldier, ""yet I should very much like to see the princess, if only for a moment.""",neutral
"She was lying on the dog's back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who saw her would know she was a real princess.",neutral
"The soldier could not help kissing her, true soldier as he was.",neutral
"""That is a very pretty story, indeed,"" said the queen.",neutral
"So the next night one of the old ladies of the court was set to watch by the princess's bed, to discover whether it really was a dream, or what else it might be.",neutral
"But the old lady put on water boots, and ran after him as quickly as he did, and found that he carried the princess into a large house.",neutral
She thought it would help her to remember the place if she made a large cross on the door with a piece of chalk.,neutral
"Then she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with the princess.",neutral
"But when he saw that a cross had been made on the door of the house, where the soldier lived, he took another piece of chalk and made crosses on all the doors in the town, so that the lady-in-waiting might not be able to find out the right door.",neutral
"Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the lady and all the officers of the household, to see where the princess had been.",neutral
"""Here it is,"" said the king, when they came to the first door with a cross on it.",neutral
"No, my dear husband, it must be that one,"" said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also.",neutral
"""And here is one, and there is another!"" they all exclaimed for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.",surprise
But the queen was a very clever woman she could do a great deal more than merely ride in a carriage.,neutral
"She took her large gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag.",neutral
"This bag she filled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess's neck and then she cut a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might be scattered on the ground as the princess went along.",neutral
"The dog did not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the soldier's house, and even up to the window, where he had climbed with the princess.",neutral
"It was not very pleasant news, and besides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn.",neutral
"Every one ran out to look at them. and a shoemaker's boy, with a leather apron and slippers on, galloped by so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating.",neutral
"""Hallo, you shoemaker's boy, you need not be in such a hurry,"" cried the soldier to him.",neutral
"""There will be nothing to see till I come but if you will run to the house where I have been living, and bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings, but you must put your best foot foremost.""",neutral
"The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.",joy
And now we shall see what happened.,neutral
"Outside the town a large gibbet had been erected, round which stood the soldiers and several thousands of people.",neutral
The king and the queen sat on splendid thrones opposite to the judges and the whole council.,neutral
"The soldier already stood on the ladder but as they were about to place the rope around his neck, he said that an innocent request was often granted to a poor criminal before he suffered death.",neutral
"He wished very much to smoke a pipe, as it would be the last pipe he should ever smoke in the world.",neutral
"The king could not refuse this request, so the soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire, once, twice, thrice,- and there in a moment stood all the dogs- the one with eyes as big as teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third, whose eyes were like towers.",neutral
"And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed to pieces.",neutral
"But the largest dog seized him, as well as the queen, and threw them after the others.",neutral
"Then the soldiers and all the people were afraid, and cried, ""Good soldier, you shall be our king, and you shall marry the beautiful princess.""",neutral
"So they placed the soldier in the king's carriage, and the three dogs ran on in front and cried ""Hurrah!"" and the little boys whistled through their fingers, and the soldiers presented arms.",neutral
"The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.",joy
"The wedding festivities lasted a whole week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes.",neutral
"The lamp in the bed-chamber had been partly shaded, and the windows were covered with heavy curtains of some costly silken material.",neutral
"The carpet was thick and soft, like a covering of moss.",neutral
"The guardian angel of the house leaned against the head of the bed while over the child was spread, as it were, a net of shining stars, and each star was a pearl of happiness.",neutral
"All the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born here sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love in short, there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth.",neutral
"""No, not everything,"" said a voice near him- the voice of the good angel of the child ""one fairy has not yet brought her gift, but she will, even if years should elapse, she will bring her gift it is the last pearl that is wanting.""",neutral
"""She will come, she will come some day unsought!""",neutral

To this child she must come.,neutral
You think that to wait for this time would be long and useless.,neutral
"Well, then, let us go for this pearl- the only one lacking amidst all this wealth.""",neutral
Then hand-in-hand they floated away to the spot where the fairy was now lingering.,neutral

Fresh roses were scattered over her.,neutral

"IN a house in Copenhagen, not far from the king's new market, a very large party had assembled, the host and his family expecting, no doubt, to receive invitations in return.",neutral

"The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes were carefully placed.",neutral
"Here sat two maidens, one young, and the other old, as if they had come and were waiting to accompany their mistresses home but on looking at them more closely, it could easily be seen that they were no common servants.",neutral

They were two fairies.,neutral

COUNSELLOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNSELLOR,neutral
"IT was late when Counsellor Knapp, lost in thought about the times of King Hans, desired to return home and fate so ordered it that he put on the goloshes of Fortune instead of his own, and walked out into the East Street.",neutral
"Through the magic power of the goloshes, he was at once carried back three hundred years, to the times of King Hans, for which he had been longing when he put them on.",neutral
"Therefore he immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of the street, which in those days possessed no pavement.",neutral
"The moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the thick foggy air, and all the objects around him were confused together in the darkness.",neutral
"At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna but the light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.",neutral
"""That is most likely a museum of art,"" thought he, ""and they have forgotten to take down the sign.""",neutral
"Two men, in the dress of olden times, passed by him.",neutral
"""What odd figures!"" thought he ""they must be returning from some masquerade.""",surprise
"Suddenly he heard the sound of a drum and fifes, and then a blazing light from torches shone upon him.",neutral
"First came a whole troop of drummers, beating their drums very cleverly they were followed by life-guards, with longbows and crossbows.",neutral
The principal person in the procession was a clerical-looking gentleman.,neutral
"""That is the bishop of Zealand.""",neutral
"""Good gracious!"" he exclaimed ""what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?""",surprise
"While musing on this strange affair, and without looking to the right or left, he walked on through East Street and over Highbridge Place.",neutral
"The bridge, which he supposed led to Palace Square, was nowhere to be found but instead, he saw a bank and some shallow water, and two people, who sat in a boat.",neutral
"""Does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the Holm?"" asked one.",neutral
"""To the Holm!"" exclaimed the counsellor, not knowing in what age he was now existing ""I want to go to Christian's Haven, in Little Turf Street.""",neutral
The men stared at him.,neutral
But the more he talked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other.,neutral
"""I don't understand your outlandish talk,"" he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.",anger
"He could not, however, find the bridge nor any railings.",neutral
"""I think it will be better for me to take a coach but where are they?""",neutral
There was not one to be seen!,neutral
"""I shall be obliged to go back to the king's new market,"" said he, ""where there are plenty of carriages standing, or I shall never reach Christian's Haven.""",neutral
"Then he went towards East Street, and had nearly passed through it, when the moon burst forth from a cloud.",neutral
"""Dear me, what have they been erecting here?"" he cried, as he caught sight of the East gate, which in olden times used to stand at the end of East Street.",surprise
"However, he found an opening through which he passed, and came out upon where he expected to find the new market.",neutral
"Nothing was to be seen but an open meadow, surrounded by a few bushes, through which ran a broad canal or stream.",neutral
"A few miserable-looking wooden booths, for the accommodation of Dutch watermen, stood on the opposite shore.",neutral
"""What can it be?",neutral
He turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill.,neutral
"In walking through the street this time, he examined the houses more closely he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster, and many had only a thatched roof.",neutral
"Suppose I were to go back now and say how ill I feel, I fear it would look so ridiculous, and it is not very likely that I should find any one up.""",neutral
"Then he looked for the house, but it was not in existence.",neutral
It is no use to stand upon ceremony.,neutral
But where in the world is the agent's house.,neutral
"There is a house, but it is not his and people still up in it, I can hear.",neutral
"As he reached the half-open door, he saw a light and went in.",neutral
"It was a tavern of the olden times, and seemed a kind of beershop.",neutral
The room had the appearance of a Dutch interior.,neutral
"A number of people, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deep conversation over their mugs, and took very little notice of the new comer.",neutral
"""Pardon me,"" said the counsellor, addressing the landlady, ""I do not feel quite well, and I should be much obliged if you will send for a fly to take me to Christian's Haven.""",neutral
Then she spoke to him in German.,neutral
The counsellor supposed from this that she did not understand Danish he therefore repeated his request in German.,neutral
"This, as well as his singular dress, convinced the woman that he was a foreigner.",neutral
"She soon understood, however, that he did not find himself quite well, and therefore brought him a mug of water.",neutral
"It had something of the taste of seawater, certainly, although it had been drawn from the well outside.",neutral
"Then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him.",neutral
"She did not understand what he meant, but she handed him the sheet it was a woodcut, representing a meteor, which had appeared in the town of Cologne.",neutral
"""That is very old,"" said the counsellor, becoming quite cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing.",joy
"It is very interesting, although the whole affair is a fable.",neutral
"Meteors are easily explained in these days they are northern lights, which are often seen, and are no doubt caused by electricity.""",neutral
"Those who sat near him, and heard what he said, looked at him in great astonishment, and one of them rose, took off his hat respectfully, and said in a very serious manner, ""You must certainly be a very learned man, monsieur.""",neutral
"""Oh no,"" replied the counsellor ""I can only discourse on topics which every one should understand.""",neutral
"""Moreover, I must add to your speech mihi secus videtur yet in this case I would suspend my judicium.""",neutral
"""May I ask to whom I have the pleasure of speaking?""",neutral
"""I am a Bachelor of Divinity,"" said the man.",neutral
This answer satisfied the counsellor.,neutral
The title agreed with the dress.,neutral
"""This is surely,"" thought he, ""an old village schoolmaster, a perfect original, such as one meets with sometimes even in Jutland.""",neutral
"""This is not certainly a locus docendi,"" began the man ""still I must beg you to continue the conversation.",neutral
"You must be well read in ancient lore.""",neutral
"""Yes, I mean the new novels that we have at the present day.""",neutral
"The king likes especially the romance of Messeurs Iffven and Gaudian, which describes King Arthur and his knights of the round table.",neutral
"He has joked about it with the gentlemen of his Court.""",neutral
"""Well, I have certainly not read that,"" replied the counsellor.",neutral
"""I suppose it is quite new, and published by Heiberg.""",neutral
"""No,"" answered the man, ""it is not by Heiberg Godfred von Gehman brought it out.""",neutral
"""Oh, is he the publisher?",neutral
"That is a very old name,"" said the counsellor ""was it not the name of the first publisher in Denmark?""",neutral
"""Yes and he is our first printer and publisher now,"" replied the scholar.",neutral
"So far all had passed off very well but now one of the citizens began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been raging a few years before, meaning the plague of 1484.",neutral
"The counsellor thought he referred to the cholera, and they could discuss this without finding out the mistake.",neutral
The war in 1490 was spoken of as quite recent.,neutral
"The English pirates had taken some ships in the Channel in 1801, and the counsellor, supposing they referred to these, agreed with them in finding fault with the English.",neutral
"The rest of the talk, however, was not so agreeable every moment one contradicted the other.",neutral
"The good bachelor appeared very ignorant, for the simplest remark of the counsellor seemed to him either too bold or too fantastic.",neutral
"They stared at each other, and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin, in the hope of being better understood but it was all useless.",neutral
"""How are you now?"" asked the landlady, pulling the counsellor's sleeve.",neutral
Then his recollection returned to him.,neutral
In the course of conversation he had forgotten all that had happened previously.,neutral
"""Goodness me! where am I?"" said he.",surprise
It bewildered him as he thought of it.,surprise
"""We will have some claret, or mead, or Bremen beer,"" said one of the guests ""will you drink with us?""",neutral
Two maids came in.,neutral
One of them had a cap on her head of two colors.,neutral

"He became at last desperate and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the man's word in the least- only begged them to get a droschky and then they thought he was speaking the Muscovite language.",neutral
Never before had he been in such rough and vulgar company.,neutral
"Just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under the table, and so creep to the door.",neutral
"He tried it but before he reached the entry, the rest discovered what he was about, and seized him by the feet, when, luckily for him, off came the goloshes, and with them vanished the whole enchantment.",neutral

"He was in East Street, as it now appears he lay with his legs turned towards a porch, and just by him sat the watchman asleep.",neutral
"""Yes, this is East Street how beautifully bright and gay it looks!",joy
"It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this.""",surprise
"Two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky, which was to drive him to Christian's Haven.",neutral
THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURES,neutral
"""No doubt, they belong to the lieutenant who lives up stairs.",neutral
"They are lying just by his door.""",neutral
"Gladly would the honest man have rung, and given them in, for a light was still burning, but he did not wish to disturb the other people in the house so he let them lie.",neutral
"""These things must keep the feet very warm,"" said he ""they are of such nice soft leather.""",neutral
"Then he tried them on, and they fitted his feet exactly.",neutral
"""Now,"" said he, ""how droll things are in this world!",neutral
"There's that man can lie down in his warm bed, but he does not do so.",neutral
There he goes pacing up and down the room.,neutral
He ought to be a happy man.,neutral
"He has neither wife nor children, and he goes out into company every evening.",neutral
"Oh, I wish I were he then I should be a happy man.""",neutral
"As he uttered this wish, the goloshes which he had put on took effect, and the watchman at once became the lieutenant.",neutral
"There he stood in his room, holding a little piece of pink paper between his fingers, on which was a poem,- a poem written by the lieutenant himself.",neutral
"Who has not had, for once in his life, a moment of poetic inspiration? and at such a moment, if the thoughts are written down, they flow in poetry.",neutral
The following verses were written on the pink paper:-,neutral
"""OH WERE I RICH!",neutral
"""Oh were I rich!",neutral
"How oft, in youth's bright hour, When youthful pleasures banish every care, I longed for riches but to gain a power, The sword and plume and uniform to wear!",neutral
"""Once in my youthful hours, when gay and free, A maiden loved me and her gentle kiss, Rich in its tender love and purity, Taught me, alas! too much of earthly bliss.",neutral
Dear child!,neutral
"She only thought of youthful glee She loved no wealth, but fairy tales and me.",neutral
"""Oh were I rich! again is all my prayer: That child is now a woman, fair and free, As good and beautiful as angels are.",neutral
"Oh, were I rich in lovers' poetry, To tell my fairy tale, love's richest lore!",neutral
But no I must be silent- I am poor.,neutral
"Ah, wilt thou pity me?",neutral
"""Oh were I rich in truth and peace below, I need not then my poverty bewail.",neutral
To thee I dedicate these lines of woe Wilt thou not understand the mournful tale?,neutral
A leaf on which my sorrows I relate- Dark story of a darker night of fate.,neutral
"Ah, bless and pity me!""",neutral
"""Well, yes people write poems when they are in love, but a wise man will not print them.",neutral
"A lieutenant in love, and poor.",neutral
"This is a triangle, or more properly speaking, the half of the broken die of fortune.""",neutral
"The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.",sadness
He knows not what I call poverty.,neutral
"He has a home, a wife and children, who weep at his sorrow and rejoice at his joy.",neutral
"At this moment the watchman again became a watchman for having, through the goloshes of Fortune, passed into the existence of the lieutenant, and found himself less contented than he expected, he had preferred his former condition, and wished himself again a watchman.",neutral
"It seemed to me as if I were the lieutenant up yonder, but there was no happiness for me.",neutral
"I missed my wife and the little ones, who are always ready to smother me with kisses.""",neutral
"He sat down again and nodded, but he could not get the dream out of his thoughts, and he still had the goloshes on his feet.",neutral
A falling star gleamed across the sky.,neutral
"""There goes one!"" cried he.",surprise
"""However, there are quite enough left I should very much like to examine these a little nearer, especially the moon, for that could not slip away under one's hands.",neutral
"The student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.",neutral
"If that were true, it would be very delightful, but I don't believe it.",neutral
"I wish I could make a little spring up there now I would willingly let my body lie here on the steps.""",neutral
There are certain things in the world which should be uttered very cautiously doubly so when the speaker has on his feet the goloshes of Fortune.,neutral
Now we shall hear what happened to the watchman.,neutral
"Nearly every one is acquainted with the great power of steam we have proved it by the rapidity with which we can travel, both on a railroad or in a steamship across the sea.",neutral
"But this speed is like the movements of the sloth, or the crawling march of the snail, when compared to the swiftness with which light travels light flies nineteen million times faster than the fleetest race-horse, and electricity is more rapid still.",neutral
"Death is an electric shock which we receive in our hearts, and on the wings of electricity the liberated soul flies away swiftly, the light from the sun travels to our earth ninety-five millions of miles in eight minutes and a few seconds but on the wings of electricity, the mind requires only a second to accomplish the same distance.",neutral
"The space between the heavenly bodies is, to thought, no farther than the distance which we may have to walk from one friend's house to another in the same town yet this electric shock obliges us to use our bodies here below, unless, like the watchman, we have on the goloshes of Fortune.",neutral
"In a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than two hundred thousand miles to the moon, which is formed of a lighter material than our earth, and may be said to be as soft as new fallen snow.",neutral
He found himself on one of the circular range of mountains which we see represented in Dr. Madler's large map of the moon.,neutral
"The interior had the appearance of a large hollow, bowl-shaped, with a depth about half a mile from the brim.",neutral
Within this hollow stood a large town we may form some idea of its appearance by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water.,neutral
"The materials of which it was built seemed just as soft, and pictured forth cloudy turrets and sail-like terraces, quite transparent, and floating in the thin air.",neutral
Our earth hung over his head like a great dark red ball.,neutral
"Presently he discovered a number of beings, which might certainly be called men, but were very different to ourselves.",neutral
A more fantastical imagination than Herschel's must have discovered these.,neutral
"Had they been placed in groups, and painted, it might have been said, ""What beautiful foliage!""",neutral
They had also a language of their own.,neutral
"No one could have expected the soul of the watchman to understand it, and yet he did understand it, for our souls have much greater capabilities then we are inclined to believe.",neutral
"Do we not, in our dreams, show a wonderful dramatic talent? each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his own character, and with his own voice no man could thus imitate them in his waking hours.",neutral
"How clearly, too, we are reminded of persons whom we have not seen for many years they start up suddenly to the mind's eye with all their peculiarities as living realities.",neutral
"In fact, this memory of the soul is a fearful thing every sin, every sinful thought it can bring back, and we may well ask how we are to give account of ""every idle word"" that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips.",neutral
The spirit of the watchman therefore understood very well the language of the inhabitants of the moon.,neutral
"They were disputing about our earth, and doubted whether it could be inhabited.",neutral
"The atmosphere, they asserted, must be too dense for any inhabitants of the moon to exist there.",neutral
"They maintained that the moon alone was inhabited, and was really the heavenly body in which the old world people lived.",neutral
They likewise talked politics.,neutral
"But now we will descend to East Street, and see what happened to the watchman's body.",neutral
He sat lifeless on the steps.,neutral
"His staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering.",neutral
"""What is it o'clock, watchman?"" inquired a passenger.",neutral
But there was no answer from the watchman.,neutral
"The man then pulled his nose gently, which caused him to lose his balance.",neutral
"The body fell forward, and lay at full length on the ground as one dead.",neutral
"We might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the soul of the man should chance to return to him, for most probably it would seek for the body in East Street without being able to find it.",neutral
"We might fancy the soul inquiring of the police, or at the address office, or among the missing parcels, and then at length finding it at the hospital.",neutral
"But we may comfort ourselves by the certainty that the soul, when acting upon its own impulses, is wiser than we are it is the body that makes it stupid.",neutral
"As we have said, the watchman's body had been taken to the hospital, and here it was placed in a room to be washed.",neutral
"Naturally, the first thing done here was to take off the goloshes, upon which the soul was instantly obliged to return, and it took the direct road to the body at once, and in a few seconds the man's life returned to him.",neutral
"However, it was all over now.",neutral
"The same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes remained at the hospital.",neutral
THE EVENTFUL MOMENT - A MOST UNUSUAL JOURNEY,neutral
"Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows what the entrance to Frederick's Hospital is like but as most probably a few of those who read this little tale may not reside in Copenhagen, we will give a short description of it.",neutral
"The hospital is separated from the street by an iron railing, in which the bars stand so wide apart that, it is said, some very slim patients have squeezed through, and gone to pay little visits in the town.",neutral
"The most difficult part of the body to get through was the head and in this case, as it often happens in the world, the small heads were the most fortunate.",neutral
This will serve as sufficient introduction to our tale.,neutral
"One of the young volunteers, of whom, physically speaking, it might be said that he had a great head, was on guard that evening at the hospital.",neutral
"The rain was pouring down, yet, in spite of these two obstacles, he wanted to go out just for a quarter of an hour it was not worth while, he thought, to make a confidant of the porter, as he could easily slip through the iron railings.",neutral
"There lay the goloshes, which the watchman had forgotten.",neutral
It never occurred to him that these could be goloshes of Fortune.,neutral
"They would be very serviceable to him in this rainy weather, so he drew them on.",neutral
"Now came the question whether he could squeeze through the palings he certainly had never tried, so he stood looking at them.",neutral
"""I wish to goodness my head was through,"" said he, and instantly, though it was so thick and large, it slipped through quite easily.",neutral
"The goloshes answered that purpose very well, but his body had to follow, and this was impossible.",neutral
"Then he tried to pull his head back again, but without success he could move his neck about easily enough, and that was all.",neutral
"His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero.",anger
"The goloshes of Fortune had placed him in this terrible position, and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free.",neutral
"No, instead of wishing he kept twisting about, yet did not stir from the spot.",neutral
"The rain poured, and not a creature could be seen in the street.",neutral
"The porter's bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose!",neutral
"He foresaw that he should have to stay there till morning, and then they must send for a smith to file away the iron bars, and that would be a work of time.",neutral
All the charity children would just be going to school: and all the sailors who inhabited that quarter of the town would be there to see him standing in the pillory.,neutral
What a crowd there would be.,neutral
This is just what he ought to have said at first.,neutral
The moment he had expressed the thought his head was free.,neutral
"But we must not suppose it was all over no, indeed, there was worse to come yet.",neutral
"The night passed, and the whole of the following day but no one sent for the goloshes.",neutral
In the evening a declamatory performance was to take place at the amateur theatre in a distant street.,neutral
"The house was crowded among the audience was the young volunteer from the hospital, who seemed to have quite forgotten his adventures of the previous evening.",neutral
"He had on the goloshes they had not been sent for, and as the streets were still very dirty, they were of great service to him.",neutral
"A new poem, entitled ""My Aunt's Spectacles,"" was being recited.",neutral
"It described these spectacles as possessing a wonderful power if any one put them on in a large assembly the people appeared like cards, and the future events of ensuing years could be easily foretold by them.",neutral
"The idea struck him that he should very much like to have such a pair of spectacles for, if used rightly, they would perhaps enable him to see into the hearts of people, which he thought would be more interesting than to know what was going to happen next year for future events would be sure to show themselves, but the hearts of people never.",neutral
"""I can fancy what I should see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the first seat, if I could only look into their hearts that lady, I imagine, keeps a store for things of all descriptions how my eyes would wander about in that collection with many ladies I should no doubt find a large millinery establishment.",neutral
"There is another that is perhaps empty, and would be all the better for cleaning out.",neutral
There may be some well stored with good articles.,neutral
"Ah, yes,"" he sighed, ""I know one, in which everything is solid, but a servant is there already, and that is the only thing against it.",neutral
"I dare say from many I should hear the words, 'Please to walk in.'",neutral
"I only wish I could slip into the hearts like a little tiny thought.""",neutral
This was the word of command for the goloshes.,neutral
"The volunteer shrunk up together, and commenced a most unusual journey through the hearts of the spectators in the first row.",neutral
"The first heart he entered was that of a lady, but he thought he must have got into one of the rooms of an orthopedic institution where plaster casts of deformed limbs were hanging on the walls, with this difference, that the casts in the institution are formed when the patient enters, but here they were formed and preserved after the good people had left.",neutral
These were casts of the bodily and mental deformities of the lady's female friends carefully preserved.,neutral
"Quickly he passed into another heart, which had the appearance of a spacious, holy church, with the white dove of innocence fluttering over the altar.",neutral
"Gladly would he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred place but he was carried on to another heart, still, however, listening to the tones of the organ, and feeling himself that he had become another and a better man.",neutral
"The next heart was also a sanctuary, which he felt almost unworthy to enter it represented a mean garret, in which lay a sick mother but the warm sunshine streamed through the window, lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof, two blue birds sang of childlike joys, and the sick mother prayed for a blessing on her daughter.",neutral
"Next he crept on his hands and knees through an overfilled butcher's shop there was meat, nothing but meat, wherever he stepped this was the heart of a rich, respectable man, whose name is doubtless in the directory.",neutral
"Then he entered the heart of this man's wife it was an old, tumble-down pigeon-house the husband's portrait served as a weather-cock it was connected with all the doors, which opened and shut just as the husband's decision turned.",neutral
"The next heart was a complete cabinet of mirrors, such as can be seen in the Castle of Rosenberg.",neutral
"But these mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree in the middle of the floor sat, like the Grand Lama, the insignificant I of the owner, astonished at the contemplation of his own features.",neutral
"At his next visit he fancied he must have got into a narrow needlecase, full of sharp needles: ""Oh,"" thought he, ""this must be the heart of an old maid"" but such was not the fact it belonged to a young officer, who wore several orders, and was said to be a man of intellect and heart.",neutral
"He could not collect his thoughts, and imagined his foolish fancies had carried him away.",neutral
"""Good gracious!"" he sighed, ""I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head.""",surprise
"And then suddenly recurred to him the strange event of the evening before, when his head had been fixed between the iron railings in front of the hospital.",neutral
A Russian bath would be a very good thing to begin with.,neutral
"I wish I were lying on one of the highest shelves.""",neutral
"Sure enough, there he lay on an upper shelf of a vapor bath, still in his evening costume, with his boots and goloshes on, and the hot drops from the ceiling falling on his face.",neutral
"The attendant stopped him with a loud cry, when he saw a man with all his clothes on.",neutral
"The volunteer had, however, presence of mind enough to whisper, ""It is for a wager"" but the first thing he did, when he reached his own room, was to put a large blister on his neck, and another on his back, that his crazy fit might be cured.",neutral
"The next morning his back was very sore, which was all he gained by the goloshes of Fortune.",neutral
THE CLERK'S TRANSFORMATION,neutral
"The watchman, whom we of course have not forgotten, thought, after a while, of the goloshes which he had found and taken to the hospital so he went and fetched them.",neutral
"But neither the lieutenant nor any one in the street could recognize them as their own, so he gave them up to the police.",neutral
"""They look exactly like my own goloshes,"" said one of the clerks, examining the unknown articles, as they stood by the side of his own.",neutral
"""It would require even more than the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other.""",neutral
"""Master clerk,"" said a servant who entered with some papers.",neutral
"The clerk turned and spoke to the man but when he had done with him, he turned to look at the goloshes again, and now he was in greater doubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or on the left belonged to him.",neutral
"""Those that are wet must be mine,"" thought he but he thought wrong, it was just the reverse.",neutral
"The goloshes of Fortune were the wet pair and, besides, why should not a clerk in a police office be wrong sometimes?",neutral
"So he drew them on, thrust his papers into his pocket, placed a few manuscripts under his arm, which he had to take with him, and to make abstracts from at home.",neutral
"Then, as it was Sunday morning and the weather very fine, he said to himself, ""A walk to Fredericksburg will do me good:"" so away he went.",neutral
There could not be a quieter or more steady young man than this clerk.,neutral
"We will not grudge him this little walk, it was just the thing to do him good after sitting so much.",neutral
"He went on at first like a mere automaton, without thought or wish therefore the goloshes had no opportunity to display their magic power.",neutral
"In the avenue he met with an acquaintance, one of our young poets, who told him that he intended to start on the following day on a summer excursion.",neutral
"""Are you really going away so soon?"" asked the clerk.",neutral
"You can roam about where you will, while such as we are tied by the foot.""",neutral
"""But it is fastened to the bread-tree,"" replied the poet.",neutral
"""You need have no anxiety for the morrow and when you are old there is a pension for you.""",neutral
"""Ah, yes but you have the best of it,"" said the clerk ""it must be so delightful to sit and write poetry.",neutral
"The whole world makes itself agreeable to you, and then you are your own master.",neutral
"You should try how you would like to listen to all the trivial things in a court of justice.""",neutral
"The poet shook his head, so also did the clerk each retained his own opinion, and so they parted.",neutral
"""I should like to try what it is to have a poetic taste, and to become a poet myself.",neutral
I am sure I should not write such mournful verses as they do.,neutral
"We perceive, by these remarks, that he had already become a poet.",neutral
"By most poets what he had said would be considered common-place, or as the Germans call it, ""insipid.""",neutral
It is a foolish fancy to look upon poets as different to other men.,neutral
There are many who are more the poets of nature than those who are professed poets.,neutral
"The difference is this, the poet's intellectual memory is better he seizes upon an idea or a sentiment, until he can embody it, clearly and plainly in words, which the others cannot do.",neutral
But the transition from a character of every-day life to one of a more gifted nature is a great transition and so the clerk became aware of the change after a time.,neutral
"""What a delightful perfume,"" said he ""it reminds me of the violets at Aunt Lora's.",joy
"Ah, that was when I was a little boy.",neutral
"She was a good old maiden lady! she lived yonder, behind the Exchange.",neutral
"She always had a sprig or a few blossoms in water, let the winter be ever so severe.",neutral
"I could smell the violets, even while I was placing warm penny pieces against the frozen panes to make peep-holes, and a pretty view it was on which I peeped.",neutral
"Out in the river lay the ships, icebound, and forsaken by their crews a screaming crow represented the only living creature on board.",neutral
"But when the breezes of spring came, everything started into life.",neutral
"Amidst shouting and cheers the ships were tarred and rigged, and then they sailed to foreign lands.",neutral
"""I remain here, and always shall remain, sitting at my post at the police office, and letting others take passports to distant lands.",neutral
Suddenly he paused.,neutral
"""Good gracious, what has come over me?",surprise
"It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful.""",joy
He felt in his pockets for some of his papers.,neutral
"""These will give me something else to think of,"" said he.",neutral
"Casting his eyes on the first page of one, he read, ""'Mistress Sigbirth an original Tragedy, in Five Acts.'",neutral
"Have I written this tragedy?""",neutral
"He read again, ""'The Intrigue on the Promenade or, the Fast-Day.",neutral
A Vaudeville.',neutral
Some one must have put them into my pocket.,neutral
"It was from the manager of a theatre the pieces were rejected, not at all in polite terms.",neutral
"""Hem, hem!"" said he, sitting down on a bench his thoughts were very elastic, and his heart softened strangely.",neutral
"Involuntarily he seized one of the nearest flowers it was a little, simple daisy.",neutral
All that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in a moment by this little flower.,neutral
"It spoke of the glory of its birth it told of the strength of the sunlight, which had caused its delicate leaves to expand, and given to it such sweet perfume.",neutral
The struggles of life which arouse sensations in the bosom have their type in the tiny flowers.,neutral
"Air and light are the lovers of the flowers, but light is the favored one towards light it turns, and only when light vanishes does it fold its leaves together, and sleep in the embraces of the air.""",neutral
"""It is light that adorns me,"" said the flower.",neutral
"""But the air gives you the breath of life,"" whispered the poet.",neutral
"Just by him stood a boy, splashing with his stick in a marshy ditch.",neutral
"The water-drops spurted up among the green twigs, and the clerk thought of the millions of animalculae which were thrown into the air with every drop of water, at a height which must be the same to them as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the clouds.",neutral
"As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, ""I must be asleep and dreaming and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.",joy
I hope I shall be able to remember it all when I wake tomorrow.,neutral
My sensations seem most unaccountable.,neutral
I have a clear perception of everything as if I were wide awake.,neutral
"I am quite sure if I recollect all this tomorrow, it will appear utterly ridiculous and absurd.",neutral
I have had this happen to me before.,neutral
"It is with the clever or wonderful things we say or hear in dreams, as with the gold which comes from under the earth, it is rich and beautiful when we possess it, but when seen in a true light it is but as stones and withered leaves.""",neutral
"""Ah!"" he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, ""they are much better off than I. Flying is a glorious power.",sadness
Happy is he who is born with wings.,neutral
"Yes, if I could change myself into anything I would be a little lark.""",neutral
"At the same moment his coat-tails and sleeves grew together and formed wings, his clothes changed to feathers, and his goloshes to claws.",neutral
"He felt what was taking place, and laughed to himself.",joy
"And then he flew up into the green boughs and sang, but there was no poetry in the song, for his poetic nature had left him.",neutral
"The goloshes, like all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly, could only attend to one thing at a time.",neutral
"He wished to be a poet, and he became one.",neutral
"Then he wanted to be a little bird, and in this change he lost the characteristics of the former one.",neutral
"Really a complete comedy could be written about it.""",neutral
"Then he flew down into the grass, turned his head about in every direction, and tapped his beak on the bending blades of grass, which, in proportion to his size, seemed to him as long as the palm-leaves in northern Africa.",neutral
In another moment all was darkness around him.,neutral
It seemed as if something immense had been thrown over him.,neutral
"In the avenue he met two school-boys, who appeared to belong to a better class of society, but whose inferior abilities kept them in the lowest class at school.",neutral
"These boys bought the bird for eightpence, and so the clerk returned to Copenhagen.",neutral
"""It is well for me that I am dreaming,"" he thought ""otherwise I should become really angry.",neutral
"First I was a poet, and now I am a lark.",neutral
It must have been the poetic nature that changed me into this little creature.,neutral
"I wonder what will be the end of it.""",neutral
"However, she allowed them for one day to place the bird in an empty cage that hung near the window.",neutral
"""It will please Polly perhaps,"" she said, laughing at a large gray parrot, who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage.",joy
"""It is Polly's birthday,"" she added in a simpering tone, ""and the little field-bird has come to offer his congratulations.""",neutral
"Polly did not answer a single word, he continued to swing proudly to and fro but a beautiful canary, who had been brought from his own warm, fragrant fatherland, the summer previous, began to sing as loud as he could.",neutral
"""Tweet, tweet,"" sighed he, ""what a dreadful snowstorm!"" and then he became silent.",neutral
"The clerk, or as the lady called him the field-bird, was placed in a little cage close to the canary, and not far from the parrot.",neutral
"The only human speech which Polly could utter, and which she sometimes chattered forth most comically, was ""Now let us be men.""",neutral
"All besides was a scream, quite as unintelligible as the warbling of the canary-bird, excepting to the clerk, who being now a bird, could understand his comrades very well.",neutral
"""I flew beneath green palm-trees, and amidst the blooming almond-trees,"" sang the canary.",neutral
"""I flew with my brothers and sisters over beautiful flowers, and across the clear, bright sea, which reflected the waving foliage in its glittering depths and I have seen many gay parrots, who could relate long and delightful stories.",neutral
"""They were wild birds,"" answered the parrot, ""and totally uneducated.",neutral
Now let us be men.,neutral
Why do you not laugh?,neutral
"If the lady and her visitors can laugh at this, surely you can.",neutral
It is a great failing not to be able to appreciate what is amusing.,neutral
"Now let us be men.""",neutral
"""Do you remember,"" said the canary, ""the pretty maidens who used to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms?",neutral
"Do you remember the delicious fruit and the cooling juice from the wild herbs?""",neutral
"""Oh, yes,"" said the parrot ""but here I am much better off.",neutral
"I am well fed, and treated politely.",neutral
I know that I have a clever head and what more do I want?,neutral
Let us be men now.,neutral
You have a soul for poetry.,neutral
I have deep knowledge and wit.,neutral
"You have genius, but no discretion.",neutral
"Oh, no I cost them something more than you.",neutral
"I keep them in order with my beak, and fling my wit about me.",neutral
Now let us be men.,neutral
"""O my warm, blooming fatherland,"" sang the canary bird, ""I will sing of thy dark-green trees and thy quiet streams, where the bending branches kiss the clear, smooth water.",neutral
"I will sing of the joy of my brothers and sisters, as their shining plumage flits among the dark leaves of the plants which grow wild by the springs.""",neutral
"""Do leave off those dismal strains,"" said the parrot ""sing something to make us laugh laughter is the sign of the highest order of intellect.",neutral
Can a dog or a horse laugh?,neutral
"No, they can cry but to man alone is the power of laughter given.",neutral
"Ha! ha! ha!"" laughed Polly, and repeated his witty saying, ""Now let us be men.""",joy
"""You little gray Danish bird,"" said the canary, ""you also have become a prisoner.",neutral
"It is certainly cold in your forests, but still there is liberty there.",neutral
"Instinctively, the clerk obeyed, and left the cage at the same moment the half-opened door leading into the next room creaked on its hinges, and, stealthily, with green fiery eyes, the cat crept in and chased the lark round the room.",neutral
A house opposite to him had a look of home.,neutral
"A window stood open he flew in, and perched upon the table.",neutral
It was his own room.,neutral
"""Let us be men now,"" said he, involuntarily imitating the parrot and at the same moment he became a clerk again, only that he was sitting on the table.",neutral
It was an uneasy dream too that I had.,neutral
The whole affair appears most absurd.,neutral
THE BEST THING THE GOLOSHES DID,neutral
"Early on the following morning, while the clerk was still in bed, his neighbor, a young divinity student, who lodged on the same storey, knocked at his door, and then walked in.",neutral
"""Lend me your goloshes,"" said he ""it is so wet in the garden, but the sun is shining brightly.",neutral
"I should like to go out there and smoke my pipe.""",neutral
"He put on the goloshes, and was soon in the garden, which contained only one plum-tree and one apple-tree yet, in a town, even a small garden like this is a great advantage.",neutral
"The student wandered up and down the path it was just six o'clock, and he could hear the sound of the post-horn in the street.",neutral
"This restless feeling would be stilled, if I could take a journey far away from this country.",neutral
"I should like to see beautiful Switzerland, to travel through Italy, and,""- It was well for him that the goloshes acted immediately, otherwise he might have been carried too far for himself as well as for us.",neutral
"In a moment he found himself in Switzerland, closely packed with eight others in the diligence.",neutral

"This was how the world treated Anne Lisbeth's boy, and how could it be otherwise.",neutral
It was his fate to be beloved by no one.,neutral
Hitherto he had been a land crab the land at last cast him adrift.,neutral
"He went to sea in a wretched vessel, and sat at the helm, while the skipper sat over the grog-can.",neutral
"He was dirty and ugly, half-frozen and half-starved he always looked as if he never had enough to eat, which was really the case.",neutral
"Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet, and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing, especially at sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board, or, more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the skipper and his boy.",neutral
"There had only been a kind of twilight all day, and it soon grew quite dark, and so bitterly cold, that the skipper took a dram to warm him.",neutral
"The bottle was old, and the glass too.",neutral
"It was perfect in the upper part, but the foot was broken off, and it had therefore been fixed upon a little carved block of wood, painted blue.",neutral
"A dram is a great comfort, and two are better still, thought the skipper, while the boy sat at the helm, which he held fast in his hard seamed hands.",neutral
"He was ugly, and his hair was matted, and he looked crippled and stunted they called him the field-laborer's boy, though in the church register he was entered as Anne Lisbeth's son.",neutral

Hold! what is that?,neutral
What has struck the boat?,neutral
"Was it a waterspout, or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them?",neutral
"It had struck on a rock, which rose from the depths of the sea, and sank at once, like an old shoe in a puddle.",neutral

"There might have been mice on board, but only one man and a half, the skipper and the laborer's boy.",neutral
"No one saw it but the skimming sea-gulls and the fishes beneath the water and even they did not see it properly, for they darted back with terror as the boat filled with water and sank.",neutral
"There it lay, scarcely a fathom below the surface, and those two were provided for, buried, and forgotten.",neutral
"The glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink, for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the shore and broken where and when, is indeed of no consequence.",neutral

"But in heaven no soul will be able to say, ""Never loved.""",neutral

She had not seen him since she carried him in her arms neither had she been for years to the count's palace it was quite a journey thither from the town.,neutral

"""Oh yes,"" answered Anne Lisbeth.",neutral
"""The boat went down with them,"" continued the woman ""Hans the skipper and the boy were both drowned so there's an end of them.",neutral

"He'll never cost you anything more, Anne Lisbeth.""",neutral
"""So they were drowned,"" repeated Anne Lisbeth but she said no more, and the subject was dropped.",neutral
"She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.",sadness
"Still she said not a word of all this she could not relieve her heart by telling the laborer's wife, lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle.",neutral
"Then the raven flew over her, screaming again as he flew.",neutral
"She had brought coffee and chicory with her, for she thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup herself.",neutral
"The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne Lisbeth seated her in a chair and fell asleep.",neutral
"Then she dreamed of something which she had never dreamed before singularly enough she dreamed of her own child, who had wept and hungered in the laborer's hut, and had been knocked about in heat and in cold, and who was now lying in the depths of the sea, in a spot only known by God.",neutral

"But suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a beautiful young form, as beautiful as the count's child, and this apparition said to her, ""The world is passing away hold fast to me, for you are my mother after all you have an angel in heaven, hold me fast"" and the child-angel stretched out his hand and seized her.",neutral
"Then there was a terrible crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces, and the angel-child was rising from the earth, and holding her by the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground but, on the other hand, something heavy hung to her feet and dragged her down, and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to her, and crying, ""If thou art to be saved, we must be saved too.",neutral
"Hold fast, hold fast.""",neutral
"They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then Anne Lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the carrier, who was to drive her back to her own home.",neutral
But when she came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the evening of the next day.,neutral
"Then she began to think of the expense, and what the distance would be to walk.",neutral

There was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea.,neutral

Now when might that have been washed overboard?,neutral
"She drew nearer, she stopped to look at the hat ""Ha! what was lying yonder?""",neutral

Then we can find no excuse for ourselves the deed is there and bears witness against us.,neutral

Anne Lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words.,neutral

Anne Lisbeth was in a fever.,neutral
"Conscience had roused the memories of superstitions, and had so acted upon her mind, that she fancied she had only half a soul, and that her child had taken the other half down into the sea.",neutral
Never would she be able to cling to the mercy of Heaven till she had recovered this other half which was now held fast in the deep water.,neutral

"How full of meaning that glance had been, as she leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no longer strength to raise!",neutral
"As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.",sadness

"People of every description entered the room, and, according to their position in society, so dared they to express their admiration.",neutral

"The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.",neutral

"""Yes, to children,"" said the apple-bough.",neutral
"By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a blunt knife without a handle, began to dig round the roots of some of the dandelion-plants, and pull them up.",neutral

She carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower.,neutral
"The object was hidden by two or three great leaves, which covered it like a shield, so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it, and it was carried more carefully than the apple-branch had ever been.",neutral
"Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there appeared the feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion.",neutral

THERE was once an Emperor who had a horse shod with gold.,neutral

"He was a beautiful creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes, and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil.",neutral

This is the reason of the Emperor's horse wearing golden shoes.,neutral
"A beetle came creeping forth from the stable, where the farrier had been shoeing the horse.",neutral
"""Great ones, first, of course,"" said he, ""and then the little ones but size is not always a proof of greatness.""",neutral

"""Understand!",surprise
"""Go along with you,"" said the farrier.",neutral
"""You're a rude fellow,"" cried the beetle, as he walked out of the stable and then he flew for a short distance, till he found himself in a beautiful flower-garden, all fragrant with roses and lavender.",anger
"Then he went on, and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a caterpillar crawling along.",neutral
"""How beautiful this world is!"" said the caterpillar.",joy
"""The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it.",joy

Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds.,neutral
"The beetle woke up with the noise and would have been glad to creep into the earth for shelter, but he could not.",neutral
"He was tumbled over and over with the rain, sometimes swimming on his stomach and sometimes on his back and as for flying, that was out of the question.",neutral
"After a while the weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes, and look about him.",neutral
"He saw something gleaming, and he managed to make his way up to it.",neutral
It was linen which had been laid to bleach on the grass.,neutral
"He crept into a fold of the damp linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so he remained lying there for a whole day and night, and the rain kept on all the time.",neutral
"Towards morning he crept out of his hiding-place, feeling in a very bad temper with the climate.",anger
"""Wonderful weather this,"" cried one of them, ""and so refreshing.",joy
"""I should like to know,"" said another, ""If the swallow who flies so far in her many journeys to foreign lands, ever met with a better climate than this.",neutral

"""Have you ever been in the Emperor's stable?"" asked the beetle.",neutral
"""There the moisture is warm and refreshing that's the climate for me, but I could not take it with me on my travels.",neutral
But the frogs either did not or would not understand him.,neutral
"""I never ask a question twice,"" said the beetle, after he had asked this one three times, and received no answer.",neutral
"Then he went on a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken crockery-ware, which certainly ought not to have been lying there.",neutral
"But as it was there, it formed a good shelter against wind and weather to several families of earwigs who dwelt in it.",neutral
"Their requirements were not many, they were very sociable, and full of affection for their children, so much so that each mother considered her own child the most beautiful and clever of them all.",neutral
"What happiness for a mother!""",joy
"""Our son,"" said another, ""had scarcely crept out of the egg, when he was off on his travels.",neutral

"How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?"" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.",joy
"""You are both quite right,"" said he so they begged him to walk in, that is to come as far as he could under the broken piece of earthenware.",neutral
"They are never ill-behaved, except when they are uncomfortable in their inside, which unfortunately often happens at their age.""",neutral
"Thus each mother spoke of her baby, and their babies talked after their own fashion, and made use of the little nippers they have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle.",neutral
"""But I shall try to get so far,"" said the beetle, and he walked off without taking any formal leave, which is considered a polite thing to do.",neutral
"May we ask you to step down into this rich mud, you must be fatigued after your journey.""",neutral
"""Certainly,"" said the beetle, ""I shall be most happy I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me I have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery.",joy
"""Perhaps you came from a dung-heap,"" observed the oldest of them.",neutral
"""No, indeed, I came from a much grander place,"" replied the beetle ""I came from the emperor's stable, where I was born, with golden shoes on my feet.",neutral
"I am travelling on a secret embassy, but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my secret.""",neutral
"Then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud, where sat three young-lady beetles, who tittered, because they did not know what to say.",neutral
"""I have never seen greater beauties, even in the royal stables,"" exclaimed the beetle, who was now resting himself.",surprise
"""Don't spoil my girls,"" said the mother ""and don't talk to them, pray, unless you have serious intentions.""",neutral
"But of course the beetle's intentions were serious, and after a while our friend was engaged.",neutral
"The mother gave them her blessing, and all the other beetles cried ""hurrah.""",joy
"Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage, for there was no reason to delay.",neutral
"The following day passed very pleasantly, and the next was tolerably comfortable but on the third it became necessary for him to think of getting food for his wife, and, perhaps, for children.",neutral
"""I have allowed myself to be taken in,"" said our beetle to himself, ""and now there's nothing to be done but to take them in, in return.""",neutral
No sooner said than done.,neutral
"Away he went, and stayed away all day and all night, and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow.",neutral
"""Well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my other daughters,"" said the mother.",neutral
"In the mean time the beetle, who had sailed across the ditch on a cabbage leaf, had been journeying on the other side.",neutral
In the morning two persons came up to the ditch.,neutral
"When they saw him they took him up and turned him over and over, looking very learned all the time, especially one, who was a boy.",neutral
"""Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone, and the black rock.",neutral
"Is not that written in the Koran?"" he asked.",neutral
"Then he translated the beetle's name into Latin, and said a great deal upon the creature's nature and history.",neutral
"The second person, who was older and a scholar, proposed to carry the beetle home, as they wanted just such good specimens as this.",neutral
"His wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth.",neutral
"""It is very comfortable here,"" he said to himself, and soon after fell asleep.",neutral
"Then he dreamed that the emperor's horse was dying, and had left him his golden shoes, and also promised that he should have two more.",neutral
"At the back, large palm-trees were growing and the sunlight made the leaves- look quite glossy and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green, and of flowers red like flame, yellow as amber, or white as new-fallen snow!",neutral
"""What a wonderful quantity of plants,"" cried the beetle ""how good they will taste when they are decayed!",joy
This is a capital store-room.,neutral
There must certainly be some relations of mine living here I will just see if I can find any one with whom I can associate.,neutral
"I'm proud, certainly but I'm also proud of being so.",neutral
"Then he prowled about in the earth, and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse, and the golden shoes he had inherited.",neutral
"Suddenly a hand seized the beetle, and squeezed him, and turned him round and round.",neutral
"The gardener's little son and his playfellow had come into the hothouse, and, seeing the beetle, wanted to have some fun with him.",neutral
"First, he was wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers' pocket.",neutral
Then the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the garden.,neutral
"Here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe, in which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast, and to this mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted.",neutral
"Now he was a sailor, and had to sail away.",neutral
"Then the little ship sailed away sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land.",neutral
"But at last, just as it went merrily out again, the two boys were called, and so angrily, that they hastened to obey, and ran away as fast as they could from the pond, so that the little ship was left to its fate.",neutral
"It was carried away farther and farther from the shore, till it reached the open sea.",neutral
"This was a terrible prospect for the beetle, for he could not escape in consequence of being bound to the mast.",neutral
Then a fly came and paid him a visit.,neutral
"You must have a pleasant time of it.""",neutral
"""Ah, but I'm not a prisoner,"" remarked the fly, and away he flew.",neutral
"Then, when I have made a step forward in the world, and found out a comfortable position, just as I could wish it to be, one of these human boys comes and ties me up, and leaves me to the mercy of the wild waves, while the emperor's favorite horse goes prancing about proudly on his golden shoes.",neutral
This vexes me more than anything.,anger
But all was not yet over.,neutral
"A boat, in which were a few young girls, came rowing up.",neutral
"""Look, yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along,"" said one of the younger girls.",neutral
"The boat now came close to our beetle's ship, and the young girls fished it out of the water.",neutral
"One of them drew a small pair of scissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted without hurting the beetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass.",neutral
"Away flew the beetle, straight through the open window of a large building there he sank down, tired and exhausted, exactly on the mane of the emperor's favorite horse, who was standing in his stable and the beetle found himself at home again.",neutral
"For some time he clung to the mane, that he might recover himself.",neutral
But what was it the farrier asked me?,neutral
"Ah, I remember now,- that's a good thought,- he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse.",neutral
"The answer is quite clear to me, now.",neutral
And this reflection put the beetle into a good temper.,joy
"The sun's rays also came streaming into the stable, and shone upon him, and made the place lively and bright.",neutral
"""Travelling expands the mind very much,"" said the beetle.",neutral
"""DING-DONG! ding-dong!""",neutral
"It sounds up from the ""bell-deep"" in the Odense-Au.",neutral
"Every child in the old town of Odense, on the island of Funen, knows the Au, which washes the gardens round about the town, and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the water-mill.",neutral
"In the Au grow the yellow water-lilies and brown feathery reeds the dark velvety flag grows there, high and thick old and decayed willows, slanting and tottering, hang far out over the stream beside the monk's meadow and by the bleaching ground but opposite there are gardens upon gardens, each different from the rest, some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls' pleasure grounds, often displaying cabbage and other kitchen plants and here and there the gardens cannot be seen at all, for the great elder trees that spread themselves out by the bank, and hang far out over the streaming waters, which are deeper here and there than an oar can fathom.",neutral
"Opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place, which is called the ""bell-deep,"" and there dwells the old water spirit, the ""Au-mann.""",neutral
This spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon the water but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself.,neutral
He is very old.,neutral
"Once the Bell hung in the church tower but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the church, which was called St. Alban's.",neutral
"Now I'll retire to rest!"" sang the Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest and that is why the place is called the ""bell-deep.""",joy
And what is the Bell telling?,neutral
"It is old, very old, as we have already observed it was there long before grandmother's grandmother was born and yet it is but a child in comparison with the Au-mann, who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with his hose of eel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons, and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard but he looks very pretty for all that.",neutral
What the Bell tells?,neutral
"To repeat it all would require years and days for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim it tells of old times, of the dark hard times, thus: ""In the church of St. Alban, the monk had mounted up into the tower.",neutral
"He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly.",neutral
"He looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed of the water was yet broad, and the monks' meadow was still a lake.",neutral
"He looked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the nuns' hill opposite, where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth from the nun's cell.",neutral
"Yes, this was the story the Bell told.",neutral
"He sat down close under me, and played with two little sticks as if they had been a stringed instrument and he sang to it.",neutral
"'Now I may sing it out aloud, though at other times I may not whisper it.",neutral
"""There was a King in those days.",neutral
They called him Canute.,neutral
"He bowed himself before bishop and monk but when he offended the free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they seized their weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast.",neutral
The violent band surrounded the church I heard tell of it.,neutral
"The crows, ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded around.",neutral
"They flew into the tower and out again, they looked down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there.",neutral
"King Canute knelt before the altar in prayer his brothers Eric and Benedict stood by him as a guard with drawn swords but the King's servant, the treacherous Blake, betrayed his master.",neutral
"Ding-dong! ding-dong"" Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the Odense-Au.",neutral
That is what grandmother told us.,neutral
"And when all the other church bells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not really the bells that are sounding, but that it is the air itself which sends forth the notes and grandmother said to us that the Bell itself said it was the air who told it to him, consequently they are agreed on that point, and this much is sure.",neutral
The air knows everything.,neutral
"It rings it out in the vault of heaven, far, far out, forever and ever, till the heaven bells sound ""Ding-dong! ding-dong!""",neutral
"A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, ""Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?""",neutral
"The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid.",neutral
"""What do you say now?",neutral
Shall we be engaged to each other?,neutral
"We should suit so well you spring, and I dance.",neutral
"""Indeed! do you think so?",neutral
"Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body.""",neutral
"""Yes but I am made of mahogany,"" said the top.",neutral
"""The major himself turned me.",neutral

Next day the ball was taken out by the boy.,neutral

"""I know very well where she is,"" sighed the top ""she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow.""",sadness
"His love increased the more, just because he could not get her and that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all.",neutral
"The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy.",neutral
"Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old.",neutral
"The top, also, was no longer young but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever for he was gilded all over.",neutral
"He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone.",neutral
"They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found.",neutral
Where could he be?,neutral
"He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof.",neutral
"And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk.",neutral

"""I am made of morocco,"" she said.",neutral
"""I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body but no one would think it, to look at me now.",neutral

"Believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden.""",neutral
"The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love and the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball.",neutral
The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin.,neutral
"""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top.""",surprise
"So the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball.",neutral
He spoke not a word about his old love for that soon died away.,neutral

"IN China, you know, the emperor is a Chinese, and all those about him are Chinamen also.",neutral
"The story I am going to tell you happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten.",neutral
The emperor's palace was the most beautiful in the world.,neutral
"It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful.",neutral
"In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed could not help noticing the flowers.",neutral
"Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest, with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great ships sailed under the shadow of its branches.",neutral
"In one of these trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so many other things to do, would stop and listen.",neutral

"""But the book in which I have read this account,"" said the emperor, ""was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood.",neutral
"There was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom all the world knew, but who was unknown to the court.",neutral
"At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said, ""Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well indeed, she can sing.",neutral
"Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song.",neutral
"Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.""",joy
"""Little maiden,"" said the lord-in-waiting, ""I will obtain for you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the nightingale for she is invited for this evening to the palace.""",neutral
"So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the court followed her.",neutral
"As they went along, a cow began lowing.",neutral
"""Oh,"" said a young courtier, ""now we have found her what wonderful power for such a small creature I have certainly heard it before.""",neutral
"""No, that is only a cow lowing,"" said the little girl ""we are a long way from the place yet.""",neutral
Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.,neutral
"""Beautiful,"" said the young courtier again.",neutral
"""Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells.""",neutral
"""No, those are frogs,"" said the little maiden ""but I think we shall soon hear her now:"" and presently the nightingale began to sing.",neutral
"She has certainly changed color at seeing so many grand people around her.""",neutral
"""Little nightingale,"" cried the girl, raising her voice, ""our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him.""",neutral
"""With the greatest pleasure,"" said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.",joy
"""It sounds like tiny glass bells,"" said the lord-in-waiting, ""and see how her little throat works.",neutral
"""Shall I sing once more before the emperor?"" asked the nightingale, who thought he was present.",neutral
"""My song sounds best in the green wood,"" said the bird but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish.",neutral
The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion.,neutral
The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.,neutral
"Beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood in the corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.",neutral
"In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the nightingale to sit on.",neutral

She was not installed as a real court cook.,neutral
"All were in full dress, and every eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin.",neutral
"The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.",joy
"The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.",joy
In fact the nightingale's visit was most successful.,neutral
"She was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, and once during the night.",neutral
"Twelve servants were appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken string fastened to her leg.",neutral
"The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people met, one said ""nightin,"" and the other said ""gale,"" and they understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of.",neutral
"Eleven peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note.",neutral
"One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written ""The Nightingale.""",neutral
"""Here is no doubt a new book about our celebrated bird,"" said the emperor.",neutral
"But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.",neutral
"As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold.",neutral
"""This is very beautiful,"" exclaimed all who saw it, and he who had brought the artificial bird received the title of ""Imperial nightingale-bringer-in-chief.""",neutral
"""That is not a fault,"" said the music-master, ""it is quite perfect to my taste,"" so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins.",neutral
But where was she?,neutral
"No one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods.",neutral
"""But we have the best bird after all,"" said one, and then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult.",neutral
"""For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled.",neutral
"It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another.""",neutral
"""This is exactly what we think,"" they all replied, and then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing.",neutral
"They all said ""Oh!"" and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said, ""it sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what.""",neutral
"The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of ""Little Imperial Toilet Singer,"" and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.",neutral
"So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song and for that same reason it pleased them better.",joy
"They could sing with the bird, which they often did.",neutral
"The street-boys sang, ""Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck,"" and the emperor himself could sing it also.",neutral
It was really most amusing.,neutral
"One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird sounded ""whizz.""",neutral
"""Whir-r-r-r"" went all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped.",neutral
"Then they sent for a watchmaker and, after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like order but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music.",neutral
"Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.",sadness
"Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever and, of course no one contradicted him.",neutral
"Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.",sadness
"The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and the ladies'-maids invited company to take coffee.",neutral
"Cloth had been laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep should be heard, and all was silent and still.",neutral
"But the emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels.",neutral
"A window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird.",neutral
"He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.",neutral
"All around the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking.",neutral
"These were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.",neutral
"""Do you remember this?""",neutral
"""I know nothing about it,"" said the emperor.",neutral
"""Music! music!"" he cried ""the large Chinese drum! that I may not hear what they say.""",neutral
"But they still went on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they said.",neutral
I have given you gold and costly presents I have even hung my golden slipper round your neck.,neutral
But the bird remained silent.,neutral
"There was no one to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note.",neutral
"Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still.",neutral
Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music.,neutral
"Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale.",neutral
"She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.",neutral
"And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs and even Death himself listened, and said, ""Go on, little nightingale, go on.""",neutral
"""Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that rich banner? and will you give me the emperor's crown?"" said the bird.",neutral
So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song and the nightingale continued her singing.,neutral
"She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners' tears.",neutral
"Then Death longed to go and see his garden, and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.",neutral

"How can I reward you?""",neutral
These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.,joy
"But now sleep, and grow strong and well again.",neutral
"I will sing to you again.""",neutral
"When he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window but not one of his servants had returned- they all believed he was dead only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang.",neutral
"""You shall sing only when it pleases you and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces.""",neutral
"""No do not do that,"" replied the nightingale ""the bird did very well as long as it could.",neutral
Keep it here still.,neutral
"I cannot live in the palace, and build my nest but let me come when I like.",neutral

The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended.,neutral

"""Ah, yes that is indeed a noble heart in the Danish arms,"" said the grandfather. and his spirit followed the second flame, which carried him out to sea, where cannons roared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heart attached itself to the breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon of an order, as he blew himself and his ship into the air in order to save the fleet.",neutral

Therefore their old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse.,neutral

"At last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary by heart but he did not know it now he had absolutely forgotten it altogether and the boards seemed to re-echo with his footsteps, and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass, so that he saw himself standing on his head and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk, and every one of them was writing down every single word that was uttered, so that it might be printed in the newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street corners.",neutral

"Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.",sadness
"It sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about, of fresh green corn in the fields, and of the time when it could soar almost up to the clouds.",neutral
The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.,sadness
"The little daisy would have liked so much to help it, but what could be done?",neutral
"Indeed, that was very difficult for such a small flower to find out.",neutral
"It entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was, how warmly the sun was shining, and how splendidly white its own petals were.",neutral
"It could only think of the poor captive bird, for which it could do nothing.",neutral
"Then two little boys came out of the garden one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips.",neutral
"They came straight towards the little daisy, which could not understand what they wanted.",neutral
"""Here is a fine piece of turf for the lark,"" said one of the boys, and began to cut out a square round the daisy, so that it remained in the centre of the grass.",neutral
"""No let it stay,"" said the other boy, ""it looks so pretty"".",neutral
"And so it stayed, and was brought into the lark's cage.",neutral
"The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.",sadness
So the forenoon passed.,neutral
"And it thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to refresh itself a little.",neutral
"You and the piece of grass are all they have given me in exchange for the whole world, which I enjoyed outside.",neutral
"Each little blade of grass shall be a green tree for me, each of your white petals a fragrant flower.",neutral
"Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost.""",sadness
"""I wish I could console the poor lark,"" thought the daisy.",neutral
"It could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its delicate petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such flowers usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying with thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but did not touch the flower.",neutral
"The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish a faint and mournful ""Tweet, tweet,"" was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.",sadness
"The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep it dropped sorrowfully.",sadness
"The boys only came the next morning when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.",sadness
The bird's body was placed in a pretty red box they wished to bury it with royal honours.,neutral
"The piece of turf, with the little daisy in it, was thrown out on the dusty highway.",neutral
Nobody thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird and had so greatly desired to comfort it.,neutral
"""Don't you know what is the matter with them?"" said the student.",neutral
"""The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it is no wonder they hang their heads.""",neutral

"""Yes,"" said the student, ""little daisies and lilies of the valley.""",neutral
"""Where do the beautiful flowers dance?"" asked little Ida.",neutral
"""Have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates of the town, where the king lives in summer, and where the beautiful garden is full of flowers?",neutral

"Well, the flowers have capital balls there, believe me.""",neutral
"""I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother,"" said Ida, ""but all the leaves were off the trees, and there was not a single flower left.",neutral
Where are they?,neutral
"I used to see so many in the summer.""",neutral
"""They are in the castle,"" replied the student.",neutral
"""You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are.",joy

"The blue violets represent little naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies.",neutral

"""No one knows anything about it,"" said the student.",neutral
"""The old steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night, sometimes comes in but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide themselves behind the long curtains, and stand quite still, just peeping their heads out.",neutral
"""Should I be able to see these flowers?""",neutral
"""Yes,"" said the student, ""mind you think of it the next time you go out, no doubt you will see them, if you peep through the window.",neutral
"I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow lily lying stretched out on the sofa.",neutral
"She was a court lady.""",neutral
"""Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these balls?"" asked Ida.",neutral
"""It is such a distance!""",neutral
"""Oh yes,"" said the student 'whenever they like, for they can fly.",neutral
"Have you not seen those beautiful red, white. and yellow butterflies, that look like flowers?",neutral
They were flowers once.,neutral
"They have flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as if they were little wings to make them fly.",neutral
"Then, if they behave well, they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in time their leaves become real wings.",neutral
"It may be, however, that the flowers in the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king's palace, and, therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at night, which take place there.",neutral
"You know him very well, do you not?",neutral
"Well, next time you go into his garden, you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be a grand ball at the castle, then that flower will tell all the others, and they will fly away to the castle as soon as possible.",neutral
"And when the professor walks into his garden, there will not be a single flower left.",neutral
"""But how can one flower tell another?",neutral
"Flowers cannot speak?""",neutral
"""No, certainly not,"" replied the student ""but they can make signs.",neutral
"Have you not often seen that when the wind blows they nod at one another, and rustle all their green leaves?""",neutral
"""Can the professor understand the signs?"" asked Ida.",neutral
"""Yes, to be sure he can.",neutral
"He went one morning into his garden, and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a beautiful red carnation.",neutral

"But the professor did not approve of such nonsense, so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it.",anger
"""Oh how funny!"" said Ida, and she laughed.",joy
Sometimes it would be a man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been stealing hearts.,neutral
Sometimes it was an old witch riding through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose.,neutral
"The flowers did hang their heads, because they had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely they were ill.",neutral
"Then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on a pretty little table, and the whole of the table drawer besides was full of beautiful things.",neutral
"Her doll Sophy lay in the doll's bed asleep, and little Ida said to her, ""You must really get up Sophy, and be content to lie in the drawer to-night the poor flowers are ill, and they must lie in your bed, then perhaps they will get well again.""",neutral
"So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.",anger

During the whole evening she could not help thinking of what the student had told her.,neutral
"And before she went to bed herself, she was obliged to peep behind the curtains into the garden where all her mother's beautiful flowers grew, hyacinths and tulips, and many others.",neutral
"""I wonder if my flowers have really been there,"" she said to herself, and then she fell asleep.",neutral
"In the night she awoke she had been dreaming of the flowers and of the student, as well as of the tiresome lawyer who found fault with him.",neutral

"""I wonder if my flowers are still lying in Sophy's bed,"" she thought to herself ""how much I should like to know.""",neutral
"""If they would only come in here,"" she thought but they did not come, and the music continued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty, that she could resist no longer.",neutral
"She crept out of her little bed, went softly to the door and looked into the room.",neutral
"There was no night-lamp burning, but the room appeared quite light, for the moon shone through the window upon the floor, and made it almost like day.",neutral
"All the hyacinths and tulips stood in two long rows down the room, not a single flower remained in the window, and the flower-pots were all empty.",neutral
"At the piano sat a large yellow lily which little Ida was sure she had seen in the summer, for she remembered the student saying she was very much like Miss Lina, one of Ida's friends.",neutral
"They all laughed at him then, but now it seemed to little Ida as if the tall, yellow flower was really like the young lady.",neutral
"She had just the same manners while playing, bending her long yellow face from side to side, and nodding in time to the beautiful music.",neutral
"The old rough doll, with the broken mouth, stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers.",neutral
"They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.",joy
Presently it seemed as if something fell from the table.,neutral
"Ida looked that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them it was, however, very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head, like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it.",neutral
"This was very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.",joy
"The carnival rod went on dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also.",neutral
"It was no use, he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little wax doll with a large black hat still he must dance.",neutral
"Then at last the other flowers interceded for him, especially those who had lain in the doll's bed, and the carnival rod gave up his dancing.",neutral
"At the same moment a loud knocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida's doll Sophy lay with many other toys.",neutral
"Then the rough doll ran to the end of the table, laid himself flat down upon it, and began to pull the drawer out a little way.",neutral
"Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished, ""There must be a ball here to-night,"" said Sophy.",surprise
"Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance but none of them came.",neutral
"Then she coughed, ""Hem, hem, a-hem"" but for all that not one came.",neutral
"The shabby doll now danced quite alone, and not very badly, after all.",neutral
"As none of the flowers seemed to notice Sophy, she let herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to make a very great noise.",neutral
"They led her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them.",neutral
"Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed she did not mind lying in the drawer at all.",joy
"Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful flowers danced in.",neutral
"Ida could not imagine where they could come from, unless they were the flowers from the king's garden.",neutral
"First came two lovely roses, with little golden crowns on their heads these were the king and queen.",neutral
"Beautiful stocks and carnations followed, bowing to every one present.",neutral
They had also music with them.,neutral
"Large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for instruments, and blew into them till they were quite red in the face.",neutral
"The bunches of blue hyacinths and the little white snowdrops jingled their bell-like flowers, as if they were real bells.",neutral
It was very beautiful to behold.,neutral
At last the flowers wished each other good-night.,neutral
"Then little Ida crept back into her bed again, and dreamt of all she had seen.",neutral
"When she arose the next morning, she went quickly to the little table, to see if the flowers were still there.",neutral
She drew aside the curtains of the little bed.,neutral
"There they all lay, but quite faded much more so than the day before.",neutral
Sophy was lying in the drawer where Ida had placed her but she looked very sleepy.,neutral
"""Do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me?"" said little Ida.",neutral
"But Sophy looked quite stupid, and said not a single word.",neutral
"Then she took a little paper box, on which were painted beautiful birds, and laid the dead flowers in it.",neutral
"""This shall be your pretty coffin,"" she said ""and by and by, when my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury you out in the garden so that next summer you may grow up again more beautiful than ever.""",neutral
"Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were James and Adolphus.",neutral
"Their father had given them each a bow and arrow, and they had brought them to show Ida.",neutral
"She told them about the poor flowers which were dead and as soon as they obtained permission, they went with her to bury them.",neutral
"The two boys walked first, with their crossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida followed, carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers.",neutral
They dug a little grave in the garden.,neutral
"James and Adolphus then fired their crossbows over the grave, as they had neither guns nor cannons.",neutral
"IN the narrow streets of a large town people often heard in the evening, when the sun was setting, and his last rays gave a golden tint to the chimney-pots, a strange noise which resembled the sound of a church bell it only lasted an instant, for it was lost in the continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose from the town.",neutral
"""The evening bell is ringing,"" people used to say ""the sun is setting!""",neutral
"Those who walked outside the town, where the houses were less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields, saw the evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the bell much more clearly.",neutral
"It seemed as though the sound came from a church, deep in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked with devout feelings.",neutral
"A considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, ""I really wonder if there is a church out in the wood.",neutral
The bell has indeed a strange sweet sound!,neutral
"Shall we go there and see what the cause of it is?""",neutral
"The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down, looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really in the wood.",neutral
"A confectioner from the town also came out and put up a stall there then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall, which was covered with pitch to protect it from the rain, but the clapper was wanting.",neutral
"When people came home they used to say that it had been very romantic, and that really means something else than merely taking tea.",neutral
"Three persons declared that they had gone as far as the end of the wood they had always heard the strange sound, but there it seemed to them as if it came from the town.",neutral
"One of them wrote verses about the bell, and said that it was like the voice of a mother speaking to an intelligent and beloved child no tune, he said, was sweeter than the sound of the bell.",neutral
"The emperor of the country heard of it, and declared that he who would really find out where the sound came from should receive the title of ""Bellringer to the World,"" even if there was no bell at all.",neutral
Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid berth but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation.,neutral
"None of them had gone far enough, nor had he, and yet he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow tree.",neutral
"It was a wisdom owl, which continually knocked its head against the tree, but he was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollow trunk of the tree was the cause of the noise.",neutral
"He was appointed ""Bellringer to the World,"" and wrote every year a short dissertation on the owl, but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before.",neutral
It was just confirmation-day.,neutral
"The clergyman had delivered a beautiful and touching sermon, the candidates were deeply moved by it it was indeed a very important day for them they were all at once transformed from mere children to grown-up people the childish soul was to fly over, as it were, into a more reasonable being.",neutral
The sun shone most brightly and the sound of the great unknown bell was heard more distinctly than ever.,neutral
"They had a mind to go thither, all except three.",neutral
"One of them wished to go home and try on her ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were the cause of her being confirmed this time, otherwise she would not have been allowed to go.",neutral
"The second, a poor boy, had borrowed a coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be confirmed in, and he had to return them at a certain time.",neutral
"The third said that he never went into strange places if his parents were not with him he had always been a good child, and wished to remain so, even after being confirmed, and they ought not to tease him for this they, however, did it all the same.",neutral
"These three, therefore did not go the others went on.",neutral
"Two of the smallest soon became tired and returned to the town two little girls sat down and made garlands of flowers, they, therefore, did not go on.",neutral
Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go still further on.,neutral
The wood was very thickly grown.,neutral
It was difficult to advance: wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high flowering convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to tree while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played.,neutral
That was very beautiful!,neutral
But the way was unfit for the girls they would have torn their dresses.,neutral
"Large rocks, covered with moss of various hues, were lying about the fresh spring water rippled forth with a peculiar sound.",neutral
"""I don't think that can be the bell,"" said one of the confirmed children, and then he lay down and listened.",neutral
"And there he remained, and let the others walk on.",neutral
"They came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches a large crab-apple tree spread its branches over it, as if it intended to pour all its fruit on the roof, upon which roses were blooming the long boughs covered the gable, where a little bell was hanging.",neutral
Was this the one they had heard?,neutral
"All agreed that it must be so, except one who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard at such a distance, and that it had quite a different sound to that which had so touched men's hearts.",neutral
"He who spoke was a king's son, and therefore the others said that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people.",neutral
"But the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger soon it seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment- the sound came from the left, from the side where the heart is.",neutral
"Now something rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before the king's son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists.",neutral
They knew each other: the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his landlord's son.,neutral
"That he had done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes, for the sound of the bell was too enticing- he felt he must go on.",neutral
"""We might go together,"" said the king's son.",neutral
"""Then we shall not meet,"" said the king's son, nodding to the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet until they bled.",neutral
"The king's son also received several good scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will now follow, for he was a quick fellow.",neutral
Ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth.,neutral
"""Shall we beat him?"" they said.",neutral
"""Shall we thrash him?",neutral
"He is a king's son!""",neutral
"But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing there were standing white star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips shining when the wind moved them apple-trees covered with apples like large glittering soap bubbles: only think how resplendent these trees were in the sunshine!",neutral
"All around were beautiful green meadows, where hart and hind played in the grass.",neutral
"There grew magnificent oaks and beech-trees and if the bark was split of any of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts there were also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings.",neutral
"The king's son often stood still and listened sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes, but soon he found that this was a mistake, and that the bell was ringing still farther in the wood.",neutral
"Now the sun is setting, and the night, the dark night, is approaching.",neutral
Yet I may perhaps see the round sun once more before he disappears beneath the horizon.,neutral
"I will climb up these rocks, they are as high as the highest trees!""",neutral
"And then, taking hold of the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height, had quite set.",neutral
"""Oh, what a splendour!""",joy
Then suddenly the poor boy with the short-sleeved jacket and the wooden shoes appeared he had arrived just as quickly on the road he had chosen.,neutral
"And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.",joy
"OUR scene is laid in Northern Jutland, in the so-called ""wild moor.""",neutral
"We hear what is called the ""Wester-wow-wow""- the peculiar roar of the North Sea as it breaks against the western coast of Jutland.",neutral
It rolls and thunders with a sound that penetrates for miles into the land and we are quite near the roaring.,neutral
"Before us rises a great mound of sand- a mountain we have long seen, and towards which we are wending our way, driving slowly along through the deep sand.",neutral
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,neutral
In one of its wings (the larger one) there is still a church.,neutral
"And at this convent we now arrive in the late evening hour but the weather is clear in the bright June night around us, and the eye can range far, far over field and moor to the Bay of Aalborg, over heath and meadow, and far across the deep blue sea.",neutral
"Now we are there, and roll past between barns and other farm buildings and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the Old Castle Farm, where the lime trees stand in lines along the walls, and, sheltered from the wind and weather, grow so luxuriantly that their twigs and leaves almost conceal the windows.",neutral
"We mount the winding staircase of stone, and march through the long passages under the heavy roof-beams.",neutral
"The wind moans very strangely here, both within and without.",neutral
"It is hardly known how, but the people say- yes, people say a great many things when they are frightened or want to frighten others- they say that the old dead choir-men glide silently past us into the church, where mass is sung.",neutral

"He has great possessions, but still he longs for more- everything must bow before the mighty Olaf Glob.",neutral
"His rich cousin at Thyland is dead, and his widow is to have the rich inheritance.",neutral
But how comes it that one relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would be?,neutral
"The widow's husband had possessed all Thyland, with the exception of the church property.",neutral
Her son was not at home.,neutral

"Perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would never come back to his home, to rule where his mother then ruled.",neutral
He summoned the widow before a law court but what did he gain thereby?,neutral
"The widow had never been disobedient to the law, and was strong in her just rights.",neutral
"Bishop Olaf of Borglum, what dost thou purpose?",neutral

Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed the horsemen and servants back to their home.,neutral
"They came from Rome with a papal decree- a ban, or bull, against the widow who had dared to offend the pious bishop.",neutral
"""What will not bend must break,"" said the Bishop of Borglum And all forsake the widow but she holds fast to her God.",neutral
He is her helper and defender.,neutral
"One servant only- an old maid- remained faithful to her and with the old servant, the widow herself followed the plough and the crop grew, although the land had been cursed by the Pope and by the bishop.",neutral
"""Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!"" cried the Bishop of Borglum.",anger
"Then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to her to a wagon, and mounted up on the wagon, with her old servant, and travelled away across the heath out of the Danish land.",neutral

No ferry-boat can sail over the bay in such weather as this.,neutral
Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.,neutral

"It sounds like a wail- it sounds like a sentence of wrath and condemnation, that must be heard far over the land, carried by the wind- sung by the wind- the wail that sometimes is silent, but never dies for ever again it rises in song, singing even into our own time this legend of the Bishop of Borglum and his hard nephew.",neutral
"It is heard in the dark night by the frightened husbandman, driving by in the heavy sandy road past the convent of Borglum.",neutral
It is heard by the sleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at Borglum.,neutral
And not only to the ear of superstition is the sighing and the tread of hurrying feet audible in the long echoing passages leading to the convent door that has long been locked.,neutral
"The door still seems to open, and the lights seem to flame in the brazen candlesticks the fragrance of incense arises the church gleams in its ancient splendor and the monks sing and say the mass over the slain bishop, who lies there in the black silver-embroidered mantle, with the crozier in his powerless hand and on his pale proud forehead gleams the red wound like fire, and there burn the worldly mind and the wicked thoughts.",neutral

"On the grave of the prince's father grew a rose-tree, the most beautiful of its kind.",neutral

It had such a sweet scent that one instantly forgot all sorrow and grief when one smelt it.,neutral

But then the rose-tree with the beautiful rose was unpacked.,neutral
"""Let us first see what the other case contains before we are angry,"" said the emperor then the nightingale was taken out, and it sang so beautifully that no one could possibly say anything unkind about it.",neutral
"""How much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the late lamented empress,"" said an old courtier, ""it has exactly the same tone, the same execution.""",neutral
"""You are right,"" said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.",sadness

That was indeed much more remarkable than the rose.,neutral

"""A jolly old sow once lived in a sty, Three little piggies has she,"" &c.",neutral
THIS story really consists of two parts.,neutral
"The first part might be left out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are useful We were staying in the country at a gentleman's seat, where it happened that the master was absent for a few days.",neutral
"In the meantime, there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her, and came, she said, to dispose of shares in her tan-yard.",neutral
"She had her papers with her, and we advised her to put them in an envelope, and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the estate, ""General War-Commissary Knight,"" &c.",neutral
"She listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused, and begged us to repeat the direction slowly.",neutral
"Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor.",anger
His outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back.,neutral
"""He doesn't bite,"" said the lady ""he has no teeth.",neutral
"And she delivered her papers, and took Puggie upon her arm.",neutral
And this is the first part of the story which might have been left out.,neutral
That's the second part.,neutral
"It was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town, and put up at the inn.",neutral
"Our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks in one half were many skins and hides, raw and tanned.",neutral
"Here was all the apparatus necessary to carry on a tannery, and it belonged to the widow.",neutral
"Puggie had died in the morning, and was to be buried in this part of the yard the grandchildren of the widow (that is, of the tanner's widow, for Puggie had never been married) filled up the grave, and it was a beautiful grave- it must have been quite pleasant to lie there.",neutral
"The grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and strewn over with sand quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle, with the neck upwards, and that was not at all allegorical.",neutral
"The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of Puggie's burial-place for all who lived in the lane the price of admission was to be a trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each might also give one for a little girl.",neutral
"And all the children out of the lane- yes, even out of the little lane at the back- flocked to the place, and each gave a button.",neutral
"The child said not a word, nor did she cry but each time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the yard.",neutral
"She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.",sadness
It was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience.,sadness
"We saw this from above and looked at from above, how many a grief of our own and of others can make us smile!",neutral
"That is the story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the tan-yard from the window.",neutral
THERE is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name.,neutral
"It is called ""Hysken"" street.",neutral
"Where the name came from, and what it means is very uncertain.",neutral
"It is said to be German, but that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called ""Hauschen,"" not ""Hysken.""",neutral
"""Hauschen,"" means a little house and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time.",neutral
"They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows but the panes consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to have glazed windows in every house.",neutral
"This was a long time ago, so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those days as ""olden times"" indeed, many centuries have passed since then.",neutral
"The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade in Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen street, and sold beer and spices.",neutral
"The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their nickname of ""pepper gentry.""",neutral
"It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry so that those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light.",neutral
"From this, all unmarried men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark, ""pepper gentry"" and this must be remembered by all those who wish to understand the story.",neutral
"These ""pepper gentlemen,"" or, as they are called in England, ""old bachelors,"" are often made a butt of ridicule they are told to put on their nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep.",neutral
"The boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus:-",neutral
"""Poor old bachelor, cut your wood, Such a nightcap was never seen Who would think it was ever clean?",neutral
"Go to sleep, it will do you good.""",neutral
"So they sing about the ""pepper gentleman"" so do they make sport of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they really know nothing of either.",neutral
"It is a cap that no one need wish for, or laugh at.",neutral
And why not?,neutral
"Well, we shall hear in the story.",neutral
"In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.",neutral
"At these times the odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever.",neutral
"Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men.",neutral
"The clerks were almost all old boys but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin.",neutral
"We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way but the ""pepper gentlemen"" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays.",neutral
"On these occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his.",neutral
"The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings.",neutral
"They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to themselves and such a weapon was often very necessary.",neutral
"After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head he had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads.",neutral
"Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter.",neutral
"He was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very remarkable.",neutral
"People knew that he came from Bremen it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there.",neutral
"His ancestors were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg.",neutral
"Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought of it all the more.",neutral
"The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together each one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in the evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out in the street.",neutral
"Only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things.",neutral
It certainly was not a very lively existence.,neutral
To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way.,neutral
"Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite deserted and gloomy.",neutral
"There were no lamps in the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted on the wall.",neutral
The dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly be heard.,neutral
"Such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find something to do and so Anthony found it.",neutral
"There were not always things to be packed or unpacked, nor paper bags to be made, nor the scales to be polished.",neutral
"So Anthony invented employment he mended his clothes and patched his boots, and when he at last went to bed,- his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head he had only to pull it down a little farther over his forehead.",neutral
"Very soon, however, it would be pushed up again to see if the light was properly put out he would touch it, press the wick together, and at last pull his nightcap over his eyes and lie down again on the other side.",neutral
But often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether every coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shop below.,neutral
"Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen so he had just to go back again to bed.",neutral
"He would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times.",neutral
"But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.",sadness
"And so it was with Anthony often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.",sadness
"Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture of life which had never faded from his heart.",neutral
"If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.",sadness
"The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to be very beautiful, but more beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthony were the beech woods in the neighborhood of Wartburg.",neutral
"More grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the rocks sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all the land of Denmark.",neutral
"The boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant it was himself.",neutral
"The little girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever and courageous she was the mayor's daughter, Molly.",neutral
"The children were playing with an apple they shook the apple, and heard the pips rattling in it.",neutral
"Then they cut it in two, and each of them took half.",neutral
"They also divided the pips and ate all but one, which the little girl proposed should be placed in the ground.",neutral
"""You will see what will come out,"" she said ""something you don't expect.",neutral
"A whole apple-tree will come out, but not directly.""",neutral
"Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.",joy
"The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth.",neutral
"""Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has taken root,"" said Molly ""no one ever should do that.",neutral
"I did so with my flowers, but only twice I wanted to see if they were growing.",neutral
"I didn't know any better then, and the flowers all died.""",neutral
"Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during the whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to be seen but black earth.",neutral
"At last, however, the spring came, and the sun shone warm again, and then two little green leaves sprouted forth in the pot.",neutral
Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.,neutral
"""Who does that stand for?"" thought he, and then came another and another.",neutral
"Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree.",neutral
"In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.",neutral
"It is called the ""Venus Mountain,"" and the story goes that the ""Lady Venus,"" one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there.",neutral
"She is also called ""Lady Halle,"" as every child round Eisenach well knows.",neutral
"She it was who enticed the noble knight, Tannhauser, the minstrel, from the circle of singers at Wartburg into her mountain.",neutral
"Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, ""Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!'""",neutral
But Anthony did not dare.,neutral
"Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, ""Lady Halle, Lady Halle,"" loudly and distinctly the rest she muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away.",neutral
Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him.,neutral
"Molly was very charming, but rather bold and how she did tease!",neutral
"They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was that of a tempting fiend.",neutral
"Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the land, the pious princess of Thuringia, whose good deeds have been immortalized in so many places through stories and legends, had greater beauty and more real grace.",neutral
"Her picture hung in the chapel, surrounded by silver lamps but it did not in the least resemble Molly.",neutral
"The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew year after year, till it became so large that it had to be transplanted into the garden, where the dew fell and the sun shone warmly.",neutral
"And there it increased in strength so much as to be able to withstand the cold of winter and after passing through the severe weather, it seemed to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy that the cold season had gone.",neutral
"In autumn it produced two apples, one for Molly and one for Anthony it could not well do less.",neutral
"The tree after this grew very rapidly, and Molly grew with the tree.",neutral

"All things change Molly's father left his old home, and Molly went with him far away.",neutral
"In our time, it would be only a journey of a few hours, but then it took more than a day and a night to travel so far eastward from Eisenbach to a town still called Weimar, on the borders of Thuringia.",neutral
"And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.",sadness
"One came by the carrier, and the other a traveller brought.",neutral
"The way was very long and difficult, with many turnings and windings through towns and villages.",neutral
"How often had Anthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda, and Anthony had thought the story applied to him, although Tristan means born in sorrow, which Anthony certainly was not nor was it likely he would ever say of Molly as Tristan said of Isolda, ""She has forgotten me.""",neutral
"But in truth, Isolda had not forgotten him, her faithful friend and when both were laid in their graves, one, on each side of the church, the linden-trees that grew by each grave spread over the roof, and, bending towards each other, mingled their blossoms together.",neutral

"A pretty room and a good bed were provided for him, and yet his reception was not what he had expected and dreamed it would be.",neutral

"""Oh,"" replied the old man, ""I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant.""",joy

"""I cannot bear it any longer,"" said the tin soldier ""I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.",sadness
"Now I know what it is to have visits from one's old recollections, and all they bring with them.",neutral
I was very nearly jumping from the shelf.,neutral
"I saw you all in your house opposite, as if you were really present.",neutral
"It was Sunday morning, and you children stood round the table, singing the hymn that you sing every morning.",neutral
"You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother.",neutral
"You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother were looking just as serious, when the door opened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, was brought into the room.",neutral
"You know she always dances when she hears music and singing of any sort so she began to dance immediately, although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get into the right time because the tune was so slow so she stood first on one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very low, but it would not suit the music.",neutral
"You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still I know it was not right to laugh.",joy
"So all this, and everything else that I have seen, keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections that bring so many thoughts with them.",neutral
"Tell me whether you still sing on Sundays, and tell me about your little sister Maria, and how my old comrade is, the other tin soldier.",neutral
"""You are given away,"" said the little boy ""you must stay.",neutral
"Don't you see that?""",neutral
"Then the old man came in, with a box containing many curious things to show him.",neutral
"Rouge-pots, scent-boxes, and old cards, so large and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen like them in these days.",neutral
"And there were smaller boxes to look at, and the piano was opened, and inside the lid were painted landscapes.",neutral
"But when the old man played, the piano sounded quite out of tune.",neutral
"Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, ""Ah, she could sing that tune.""",joy
Where could he have fallen?,neutral
"The old man searched, and the little boy searched, but he was gone, and could not be found.",neutral
"""I shall find him again,"" said the old man, but he did not find him.",neutral
The boards of the floor were open and full of holes.,neutral
"The tin soldier had fallen through a crack between the boards, and lay there now in an open grave.",neutral
"The day went by, and the little boy returned home the week passed, and many more weeks.",neutral
"It was winter, and the windows were quite frozen, so the little boy was obliged to breathe on the panes, and rub a hole to peep through at the old house.",neutral
"Snow drifts were lying in all the scrolls and on the inscriptions, and the steps were covered with snow as if no one were at home.",neutral
"In the evening, a hearse stopped at the door, and the old man in his coffin was placed in it.",neutral
"A few days after, there was an auction at the old house, and from his window the little boy saw the people carrying away the pictures of old knights and ladies, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the cup-boards.",neutral
"Some were taken one way, some another.",neutral
"Her portrait, which had been bought at the picture dealer's, went back again to his shop, and there it remained, for no one seemed to know her, or to care for the old picture.",neutral
In the spring they began to pull the house itself down people called it complete rubbish.,neutral
"From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.",neutral
"""What a good riddance,"" said the neighbors' houses.",neutral
"Very shortly, a fine new house was built farther back from the road it had lofty windows and smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where the old house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild vines grew up over the neighboring walls in front of the garden were large iron railings and a great gate, which looked very stately.",neutral
People used to stop and peep through the railings.,neutral
"The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.",joy
"She was planting it herself with her little hands, and pressing down the earth with her fingers.",neutral
Out of the soft earth something was sticking up.,neutral
"And the young wife wiped the soldier, first with a green leaf, and then with her fine pocket-handkerchief, that smelt of such beautiful perfume.",neutral
"""Let me see him,"" said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, ""It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy.""",joy
"""It is very likely that this is really the same soldier,"" said she, and I will take care of him, and always remember what you have told me but some day you must show me the old man's grave.""",neutral
"""I don't know where it is,"" he replied ""no one knows.",neutral
"All his friends are dead no one took care of him, and I was only a little boy.""",neutral
"""Yes, terribly lonely,"" cried the tin soldier ""still it is delightful not to be forgotten.""",joy
"""Delightful indeed,"" cried a voice quite near to them no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-",neutral
"""Gilding will fade in damp weather, To endure, there is nothing like leather.""",neutral
But the tin soldier did not believe any such thing.,neutral
"IN the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree.",neutral
"It was just three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as the same number of days might be to us we wake by day and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams.",neutral
"It is different with the tree it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes.",neutral
"Winter is its time for rest its night after the long day of spring, summer, and autumn.",neutral
How very short.,neutral
"It must be quite melancholy.""",neutral
"""Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.""",joy
"""But only for one day, and then it is all over.""",neutral
"Are you all over too?""",neutral
"""No I shall very likely live for thousands of your days, and my day is whole seasons long indeed it is so long that you could never reckon it out.""",neutral
"""No? then I don't understand you.",neutral
"You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy.",joy
"Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?""",neutral
"""No,"" replied the tree ""it will certainly last much longer,- infinitely longer than I can even think of.",neutral
"""Well, then,"" said the little fly, ""we have the same time to live only we reckon differently.""",neutral
"And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.",joy
"The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.",joy
The fly was dead.,neutral
"And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.",neutral
The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.,joy
"The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening of autumn its time of rest, its night drew nigh- winter was coming.",neutral
"Already the storms were singing, ""Good-night, good-night.""",neutral
Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf.,neutral

It was the largest and best tree in the forest.,neutral
"Its summit towered above all the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that it served as a landmark to the sailors.",neutral
It had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it.,neutral
"In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs and in autumn, when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea.",neutral
"But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches that sprang forth from the trunk.",neutral
It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream.,neutral
"All that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him, as in a festive procession.",neutral

"The watchfires again blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree.",neutral
"Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.",joy
"The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live.",neutral
"Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.",joy
"As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.",joy

In this manner he soon lost all his money.,neutral
"At last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers, an old dressing-gown, and four shillings.",neutral

"However, he got safely in his trunk to the land of Turkey.",neutral
"He hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves, and then went into the town: he could so this very well, for the Turks always go about dressed in dressing-gowns and slippers, as he was himself.",neutral

They had something better to do than that.,neutral
She wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows but for her there was neither peace nor rest.,neutral
"And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.",neutral

Then she knew that she was forsaken by every one and damned by the angel of God.,neutral

"Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: ""O God! help me!""",sadness

"My mother could make fishermen's nets, for which there was a great demand here in the bay and we lived a long time by the side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears, and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears for sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.",neutral
"Aphtanides knew how to manage our boat, and I often sat in it, with my little Anastasia, while it glided on through the water, swift as a bird flying through the air.",neutral
"Then, when the sun set, how beautifully, deeply blue, would be the tint on the mountains, one rising above the other in the far distance, and the summit of mount Parnassus rising above them all like a glorious crown.",neutral
"Its top glittered in the evening rays like molten gold, and it seemed as if the light came from within it for long after the sun had sunk beneath the horizon, the mountain-top would glow in the clear, blue sky.",neutral
"The white aquatic birds skimmed the surface of the water in their flight, and all was calm and still as amid the black rocks at Delphi.",neutral
"I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in our church.",neutral
"The summer came, and the burning heat of the sun tinted the leaves of the trees with lines of gold.",neutral
"I thought of our cool mountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed near it my mother, too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home.",neutral
"Not a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a shooting star showed that in the heavens there was yet life.",neutral
"I know not whether the clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the radiance came from the stars but we could distinguish quite plainly the outline of the mountains.",neutral
"We reached our old home but the cottage was in ruins, and we had to build a new one.",neutral
"With the aid of some neighbors, chiefly women, the walls were in a few days erected, and very soon covered with a roof of olive-branches.",neutral
"My mother obtained a living by making bottle-cases of bark and skins, and I kept the sheep belonging to the priests, who were sometimes peasants, while I had for my playfellows Anastasia and the turtles.",neutral
Once our beloved Aphtanides paid us a visit.,neutral
"A month afterwards he came again to wish us good-bye, and brought with him a large fish for my mother.",neutral
"He told us he was going in a ship to Corfu and Patras, and could relate a great many stories, not only about the fishermen who lived near the gulf of Lepanto, but also of kings and heroes who had once possessed Greece, just as the Turks possess it now.",neutral
"I have seen a bud on a rose-bush gradually, in the course of a few weeks, unfold its leaves till it became a rose in all its beauty and, before I was aware of it, I beheld it blooming in rosy loveliness.",neutral
The same thing had happened to Anastasia.,neutral
"Unnoticed by me, she had gradually become a beautiful maiden, and I was now also a stout, strong youth.",neutral
"The wolf-skins that covered the bed in which my mother and Anastasia slept, had been taken from wolves which I had myself shot.",neutral
"Years had gone by when, one evening, Aphtanides came in.",neutral
"He had grown tall and slender as a reed, with strong limbs, and a dark, brown skin.",neutral
"He kissed us all, and had so much to tell of what he had seen of the great ocean, of the fortifications at Malta, and of the marvellous sepulchres of Egypt, that I looked up to him with a kind of veneration.",neutral
His stories were as strange as the legends of the priests of olden times.,neutral
"No people have such grand old customs as we Greeks.""",neutral
"At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little church, with a silver lamp hanging before the altar.",neutral
"I put on my best clothes, and the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my hips.",neutral
"The red jacket fitted tight and close, the tassel on my Fez cap was of silver, and in my girdle glittered a knife and my pistols.",neutral
"Aphtanides was clad in the blue dress worn by the Greek sailors on his breast hung a silver medal with the figure of the Virgin Mary, and his scarf was as costly as those worn by rich lords.",neutral
Every one could see that we were about to perform a solemn ceremony.,neutral
"When we entered the little, unpretending church, the evening sunlight streamed through the open door on the burning lamp, and glittered on the golden picture frames.",neutral
"We knelt down together on the altar steps, and Anastasia drew near and stood beside us.",neutral
"A long, white garment fell in graceful folds over her delicate form, and on her white neck and bosom hung a chain entwined with old and new coins, forming a kind of collar.",neutral
"Her black hair was fastened into a knot, and confined by a headdress formed of gold and silver coins which had been found in an ancient temple.",neutral
No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than these.,neutral
"Her countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars.",neutral
"We all three offered a silent prayer, and then she said to us, ""Will you be friends in life and in death?""",neutral
"""Yes,"" we replied.",neutral
"""Will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, 'My brother is a part of myself his secret is my secret, my happiness is his self-sacrifice, patience, everything belongs to me as they do to him?'""",neutral
"And we again answered, ""Yes.""",neutral
"After this a priest came through a door near the altar, and blessed us all three.",neutral
"Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the altar-screen, and the bond of eternal friendship was confirmed.",neutral
How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage by the Delphian springs!,neutral
"On the evening before his departure, Aphtanides sat thoughtfully beside me on the slopes of the mountain.",neutral
"His arm was flung around me, and mine was round his neck.",neutral
"We spoke of the sorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country who could be trusted.",neutral
Every thought of our souls lay clear before us.,neutral
"Presently I seized his hand: ""Aphtanides,"" I exclaimed, ""there is one thing still that you must know,- one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven.",neutral
"My whole soul is filled with love,- with a love stronger than the love I bear to my mother and to thee.",neutral
"""And whom do you love?"" asked Aphtanides.",neutral
And his face and neck grew red as fire.,neutral
"""I love Anastasia,"" I replied.",neutral
"I bent towards him, I kissed his forehead, and whispered, ""I have never spoken of this to her, and perhaps she does not love me.",neutral
"Brother, think of this I have seen her daily, she has grown up beside me, and has become a part of my soul.""",neutral
"I may not wrong thee, nor will I do so.",neutral
"In a year we will see each other again, but then you will be married shall it not be so?",neutral
"I have a little gold of my own, it shall be yours.",neutral
"You must and shall take it.""",neutral
We wandered silently homeward across the mountains.,neutral
It was late in the evening when we reached my mother's door.,neutral
Anastasia held the lamp as we entered my mother was not there.,neutral
"""Sorry!"" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.",sadness
"I could not speak but he seized her hand and said, ""Our brother yonder loves you, and is he not dear to you?",neutral
"His very silence now proves his affection.""",neutral
"Then I saw no one, thought of none, but her.",neutral
"As she flung her arms round my neck, the lamp fell to the ground, and we were in darkness, dark as the heart of poor Aphtanides.",neutral
"Before daybreak he rose, kissed us all, and said ""Farewell,"" and went away.",neutral
He had given all his money to my mother for us.,neutral
"Anastasia was betrothed to me, and in a few days afterwards she became my wife.",neutral
"IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe.",neutral
"It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter.",neutral
"In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence.",neutral
"The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain.",neutral
"There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room.",neutral
"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.",joy
"The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about.",neutral
"A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open.",neutral
"She called out to the others, ""Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at.""",neutral
"It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate.",neutral
"""Each has its own value,"" said the wagon ""we cannot all be noblemen there must be some to do the work.""",neutral
The money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation.,neutral
"But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home they were to arrange for him to do so and so they did.",neutral
The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it.,neutral
"Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first.",neutral
"The rocking-horse spoke of training and races the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them.",neutral
"The clock talked politics- ""tick, tick"" he professed to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly.",neutral
"The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid.",neutral
"But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married.",neutral
"It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side.",neutral
"The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long.",neutral
"The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.",joy
"So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen.",neutral
"All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking.",neutral
"His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time- of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass.",neutral
Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner.,neutral
"The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money.",neutral
"The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle.",neutral
"This was the beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story.",neutral
"MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them his only ambition was to be always well dressed.",neutral
"He did not care for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him the only thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of clothes.",neutral
"He had a coat for every hour of the day and as one would say of a king ""He is in his cabinet,"" so one could say of him, ""The emperor is in his dressing-room.""",neutral
"One day two swindlers came to this city they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined.",neutral
"Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid.",neutral
"And he gave a large sum of money to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss of time.",neutral
"They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms.",neutral
"They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.",neutral
"""I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,"" thought the emperor.",neutral
"""He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.""",neutral
The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat before the empty looms.,neutral
"""Heaven preserve us!"" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, ""I cannot see anything at all,"" but he did not say so.",surprise
"Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms.",neutral
"""Now, have you got nothing to say?"" said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving.",neutral
"""We are pleased to hear that,"" said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.",joy
"The old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the emperor what they said and so he did.",neutral
"Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, which they required for weaving.",neutral
"They kept everything for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms.",neutral
"Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearly finished.",neutral
"Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.",neutral
Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth.,neutral
"At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom.",neutral
"With a number of courtiers, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread.",neutral
"""Your Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern.""",neutral
"And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they imagined the others could see the cloth.",neutral
"All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, ""It is very beautiful.""",neutral
And all advised him to wear the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take place.,neutral
"The whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles.",neutral
People should see that they were busy to finish the emperor's new suit.,neutral
"They pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: ""The emperor's new suit is ready now.""",neutral
"""Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,"" said the swindlers, ""that we may assist your Majesty in putting on the new suit before the large looking-glass?""",neutral
"The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit upon him, one piece after another and the emperor looked at himself in the glass from every side.",neutral
"The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready.",neutral
"""I am ready,"" said the emperor.",neutral
"Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that people should think he admired his garments.",neutral
"Nobody wished to let others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office or too stupid.",neutral
Never emperor's clothes were more admired.,neutral
"That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they were right but he thought to himself, ""Now I must bear up to the end.""",neutral
"And the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.",neutral
One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.,neutral
"He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.",neutral
"A gig was coming along the road it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.",neutral
"As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.",neutral
"That wood was full of rabbit holes and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.",neutral
Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).,neutral
"She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).",neutral
Peter was sitting by himself.,neutral
"""Peter,"" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, ""who has got your clothes?""",neutral
"Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.",neutral
Peter said he hoped that it would rain.,neutral
"At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: ""Cotton-tail!",neutral
"Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!""",neutral
Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.,neutral
"They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.",neutral
From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.,neutral
"Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.",neutral
"Little Benjamin said: ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.""",neutral
"Peter fell down head first but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.",neutral
It had been sown with lettuces.,neutral
"They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.",neutral
"Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket- handkerchief.",neutral
They took them off the scarecrow.,neutral
"There had been rain during the night there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.",neutral
"Benjamin tried on the tam-o'- shanter, but it was too big for him.",neutral
"Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.",neutral
"Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.",joy
He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.,neutral
(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.),neutral
The lettuces certainly were very fine.,neutral
Presently he dropped half the onions.,neutral
Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables.,neutral
"They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.",neutral
Presently Peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again.,neutral
"They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs.",neutral
This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!,neutral
"Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.",neutral
. . .,neutral
"The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.",neutral
Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!,neutral
"Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.",neutral
She sat there for FIVE HOURS.,neutral
"The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon but still the cat sat upon the basket.",neutral
"At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.",neutral
The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.,neutral
"He was smoking a pipe of rabbit- tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.",neutral
He was looking for his son.,neutral
Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.,neutral
"He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.",neutral
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.,surprise
"When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.",neutral
Then he took out his nephew Peter.,neutral
"Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.",neutral
When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.,surprise
It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!,neutral
"Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit- tobacco.",neutral
"Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes.",neutral
He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.,neutral
"Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.""",neutral
"""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring- time,"" replied prudent Timothy.",neutral
"When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.",neutral
Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig they worked away quietly by themselves.,neutral
Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.,neutral
"They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.",neutral
"When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker the nuts rattled down--down--down inside.",neutral
"""How shall you ever get them out again?",neutral
They did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them!,neutral
"Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.",neutral
The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.,neutral
"He began to dig, and he could not remember.",neutral
And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him and there was a fight.,neutral
"And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!",neutral
"Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders.",neutral
"There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.",neutral
The squirrels followed and listened.,neutral
"Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer.",neutral
"It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.",neutral
"They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in.",neutral
The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure.,neutral
"They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.",neutral
"Timmy Tiptoes made no reply he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself.",neutral
Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home.,neutral
She made a cup of tea for Timmy but he didn't come and didn't come.,neutral
Next morning she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.,neutral
"She wandered all over the wood, calling--",neutral
In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses.,neutral
"Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.",sadness
"There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?",neutral
"The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!""",neutral
It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.,joy
"While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities --""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself?",neutral
"""Just another nut--or two nuts let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk.",neutral
Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!,neutral
Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.,neutral
"She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again.",neutral
"She hid them under a tree root they rattled down, down, down.",neutral
"Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.",neutral
"What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?""",neutral
"""I am sure I beg your pardon I did not know that anybody lived here,"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes ""but where is Chippy Hackee?",neutral
"""I know where Chippy is a little bird told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.",neutral
"She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.",neutral
"""My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about?",neutral
"Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!""",neutral
"""You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,"" said Goody Tiptoes.",neutral
"""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!""",neutral
Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--,neutral
"""For the diddlum day Day diddle durn di!",neutral
"Day diddle diddle dum day!""",neutral
"Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--""Timmy Tiptoes!",neutral
"And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?",neutral
"Why, certainly!""",neutral
"Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come he stayed down below and chuckled.",joy
"And so it went on for a fort- night till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.",neutral
"Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.",neutral
"But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.",neutral
At last a large bear came walking through the wood.,neutral
Perhaps he also was looking for nuts he seemed to be sniffing around.,neutral
"And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head and he was more uncomfortable still.",sadness
And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock.,neutral
"And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--""Who's-been-digging- up MY-nuts?",neutral
"Who's been dig- ging-up MY-nuts?""",neutral
But nobody ever answers!,neutral
Once upon a time there was a village shop.,neutral
"The name over the window was ""Ginger and Pickles.""",neutral
It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls-- Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.,neutral
The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits.,neutral
Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.,neutral
"They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.",neutral
"In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops.",neutral
Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.,neutral
"Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier.",neutral
"Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.",neutral
"""I have the same feeling about rats,"" replied Pickles, ""but it would never do to eat our customers they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's.""",neutral
(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village.,neutral
She did not give credit.),neutral
"But there is no money in what is called the ""till.""",neutral
Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.,neutral
"Now the meaning of ""credit"" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time.",neutral
"And Pickles makes a low bow and says, ""With pleasure, madam,"" and it is written down in a book.",neutral
"The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers.",neutral
But there was always no money they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.,neutral
"But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.",neutral
"As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.",neutral
Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.,neutral
They ate them by candle- light after the shop was closed.,neutral
"""The place is full of policemen.",neutral
I met one as I was coming home.,neutral
"""Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.""",neutral
"""I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,"" replied Ginger.",neutral
"When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license.",neutral
"""It is your own fault for being a terrier _I_ do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.""",neutral
"""Where are all the cream crackers?""",neutral
"""You have eaten them yourself."" replied Ginger.",neutral
Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.,neutral
They did accounts.,neutral
"They added up sums and sums, and sums.",neutral
"""Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail he has had an ounce and three- quarters of snuff since October.",neutral
"""What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?""",neutral
"""Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'"" replied Ginger.",neutral
"Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.",anger
"The policeman went on writing in his notebook twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.",neutral
But still the policeman took no notice.,neutral
"He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.",neutral
"After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door.",neutral
They came out of the back parlor.,neutral
"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!",neutral
At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.,neutral
The policeman had disappeared.,neutral
But the envelope remained.,neutral
"""Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman?",neutral
"""No,"" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, ""it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4."" [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]",neutral
"They put up the shutters, and left.",neutral
But they have not removed from the neighborhood.,neutral
In fact some people wish they had gone further.,neutral
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,neutral
I do not know what occupation he pursues he looks stout and comfortable.,neutral
Pickles is at present a game- keeper.,neutral
After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.,neutral
"But they did not keep ""self- fitting sixes"" and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.",neutral
The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.,neutral
Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny and she continued to refuse to give credit.,neutral
"Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.",neutral
"But a person cannot live on ""seed wigs"" and sponge cake and butter buns--not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy's!",neutral
And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.,neutral
"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but ""very snug"" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.",neutral
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,neutral
Grand cooperative Jumble!,neutral
Penny's penny prices!,neutral
"Come buy, come try, come buy!""",neutral
The poster really was most 'ticing.,neutral
There was a rush upon the opening day.,neutral
"The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit cannisters.",neutral
"Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash but she is quite harmless.",anger
And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.,neutral
What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!,neutral
"Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.",anger
She tried to hide her eggs but they were always found and carried off.,neutral
She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.,neutral
She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.,neutral
She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.,neutral
"When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.",neutral
She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.,neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying.,neutral
"She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.",neutral
She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.,neutral
"She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.",neutral
Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place.,neutral
She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.,joy
"But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.",surprise
He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.,neutral
The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--,neutral
"""Madam, have you lost your way?"" said he.",neutral
"He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.",neutral
Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.,neutral
"She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place.",neutral
"""Ah! is that so?",neutral
He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.,neutral
Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.,anger
How interesting!,joy
I wish I could meet with that fowl.,neutral
I would teach it to mind its own business!,neutral
"""But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed.",neutral
"No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way.",neutral
"You may sit there as long as you like,"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.",neutral
"He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves.",neutral
"It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.",neutral
"""This is my summer residence you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman.",neutral
"There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes.",neutral
The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.,neutral
The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating but it was comfortable and very soft.,neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.,surprise
"When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.",neutral
He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.,neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon she laid nine eggs in the nest.,neutral
They were greeny white and very large.,neutral
The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.,joy
"At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--""and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched.",neutral
"They might catch cold,"" said the conscientious Jemima.",neutral
"""Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag I will provide oats.",neutral
"But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat.",neutral
"""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet?",neutral
"Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley.",neutral
"I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet,"" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.",neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.,neutral
"She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.",neutral
And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.,neutral
"The collie dog Kep met her coming out, ""What are you doing with those onions?",neutral
"Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?""",neutral
He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.,neutral
"Then he went out, and trotted down the village.",neutral
He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.,neutral
"Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon.",neutral
She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.,neutral
"She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.",neutral
"""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs.",neutral
Give me the herbs for the omelet.,neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.,neutral
She felt surprised and uncomfortable.,surprise
While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.,neutral
"Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it.",neutral
"A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.",neutral
And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.,neutral
Presently Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle- duck.,neutral
Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.,neutral
"He had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping.",neutral
"She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.",neutral
Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves but she had always been a bad sitter.,neutral
Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.,neutral
"She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.",neutral
Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.,neutral
"The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--""Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!"" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.",joy
Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.,neutral
"Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.",neutral
I went into the garden there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.,neutral
I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.,neutral
Cross-patch tried to bite me.,anger
"""Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up.",neutral
"Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland.""",neutral
"""And they drink bucketfuls of milk I shall have to get another cow!",neutral
Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework but the others must go.,neutral
"Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether.""",neutral
"So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross- patch rode away in a cart.",neutral
"And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market.",neutral
"We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard.",neutral
"Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.",sadness
"Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--",sadness
"""Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market.",neutral
Take your brother Alexander by the hand.,neutral
"Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose"" --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--""beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs always walk upon your hind legs.""",neutral
"Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.",sadness
"Mind--"" ""Wee, wee, wee!"" interrupted Alexander again.",neutral
"""You put me out,"" said Aunt Pettitoes--""Observe signposts and milestones do not gobble herring bones--"" ""And remember,"" said I impressively, ""if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back.",neutral
"Alexander, you are not attending.",neutral
Here are two licenses permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.,neutral
Attend Alexander.,neutral
"I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman.""",neutral
"I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper.",neutral
Then they started.,neutral
Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile at least Pigling Bland did.,neutral
Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.,neutral
"He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--",joy
"let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?""",neutral
Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.,neutral
"Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time he had already eaten all his own peppermints--""Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?""",neutral
"""But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,"" said Pigling Bland doubtfully.",neutral
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.,joy
Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.,anger
"But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--",joy
"""Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!",neutral
"""But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'""",neutral
"""What's that, young Sirs?",neutral
Stole a pig?,neutral
"Where are your licenses?"" said the policeman.",neutral
They had nearly run against him round a corner.,neutral
"Pigling Bland pulled out his paper Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply--",neutral
"""It's not likely they let you start without.",neutral
I am passing the farm.,neutral
"You may walk with me.""",neutral
"""Can I come back too?"" inquired Pigling Bland.",neutral
"""I see no reason, young Sir your paper is all right.""",neutral
"But it is unwise to argue with the police he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.",neutral
I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood he did fairly well when he had settled down.,neutral
"Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.",surprise
"He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain.",neutral
"""I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes,"" said Pigling Bland.",neutral
"He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.",neutral
"It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.",neutral
"After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.",neutral
"The road crossed a moor below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond --in misty distance--lay the hills.",neutral
"He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --""I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?"" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.",sadness
"""Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!"" scolded the disturbed cockerel.",anger
"In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.",neutral
In less than an hour they were all awakened.,neutral
"The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.",neutral
"He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner.",neutral
"Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.",neutral
"The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks.",neutral
"Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.",neutral
"At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out.",neutral
"""This one's come of himself, whatever,"" said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out.",neutral

"Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands.",neutral
Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.,neutral
"Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.",neutral
Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.,neutral
"Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.",neutral
"Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third-after glaring at Pigling-- he put away with much scuffling, and locked up.",neutral
Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.,neutral
"After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal.",neutral
"Besides, the hens had seen this pig.",neutral
"He looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at Pigling.",neutral
"""You may sleep on the rug,"" said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.",neutral
Pigling Bland slept like a top.,neutral
In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge the weather was warmer.,neutral
"He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--""You'll likely be moving on again?"" said he to Pigling Bland.",neutral
"Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate.",neutral
"It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.",neutral
"After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage everything was locked up.",neutral
He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.,neutral
"Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.",neutral
He sang while he worked--,neutral
"""Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys-- ""And they all ran to hear him play, ""Over the hills and far away!--""",neutral

"""Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off.""",neutral
"After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen there was nobody there.",neutral
"After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole.",neutral
It was quite quiet.,neutral
"After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door.",neutral
It was sucked in immediately.,neutral
In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.,neutral
"When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil the meal was not get-at-able.",neutral
"Mr. Piperson was very affable he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.",neutral
He did lock the cupboard door but without properly shutting it.,neutral
"He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.",neutral
"Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.",neutral
"All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--""My name is Pig-wig.",neutral

A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.,joy
"She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.",neutral
"She pointed at Pigling's plate he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--""How did you come here?"" asked Pigling Bland.",neutral
"""Stolen,"" replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full.",neutral
Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.,neutral
"""What for?""",neutral

Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.,neutral
"When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.",neutral
Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture.,neutral

"For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the button- holes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist.",neutral

Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.,neutral
"Now, this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.",neutral
Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.,neutral
"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.",neutral
"He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.",neutral
"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.",neutral
Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.,neutral
It was a big old- fashioned fireplace.,neutral
The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.,neutral
So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.,neutral
"He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.",neutral
"Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.",neutral
Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.,neutral
"He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.",neutral
The chimney was a very big old- fashioned one.,neutral
It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.,neutral
"The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.",neutral
"He climbed up, and up, and up.",neutral
Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.,neutral
He was like a little sweep himself.,neutral
One flue seemed to lead into another.,neutral
He scrambled up and up but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.,neutral
There were some mutton bones lying about.,neutral
"""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten.",neutral
"""Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?",neutral
"It makes me sneeze,"" said Tom Kitten.",neutral
He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.,neutral
"He groped his way carefully for several yards he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.",neutral
"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.",neutral
"It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.",neutral
Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.,neutral
"""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" said the rat, chattering his teeth.",anger
There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.,neutral
. .,neutral
". . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.",neutral
Anna Maria did the tying.,neutral
The old rat watched her and took snuff.,neutral
"When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.",neutral
"""It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin,"" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.",neutral
The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.,neutral
Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.,neutral
He did not meet anybody.,neutral
He made a second journey for the rolling pin.,neutral
"He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.",neutral
"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.",neutral
They did not see him.,neutral
Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.,neutral
She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.,neutral
She did not observe Moppet.,neutral
"But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.",neutral
"Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.",neutral
It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles.,neutral
It did not offer to assist him.,neutral
Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.,neutral
"First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.",neutral
"""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel Whiskers.",neutral
She laid hold of his ears.,neutral
"Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly roly-poly, roly.",anger
The rats each held an end.,neutral
"Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!",surprise
"""Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,"" said Anna Maria.",neutral
"""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.""",neutral
So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!,neutral
"Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.",neutral
They invited him to stay to dinner.,neutral
"The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.",neutral
They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.,neutral
"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.",neutral
They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.,neutral
Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.,neutral
Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.,anger
"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.",neutral
I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!,neutral
They went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow.,neutral
"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.",neutral
"As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.",anger
"There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!",neutral
"They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.",neutral
And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers-- children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.,neutral
There is no end to them!,neutral
Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.,neutral
"They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment.",neutral
They charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably.,neutral
"They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.",neutral
A Mouse.,neutral
"This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.",neutral
"He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.",neutral
"In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.",neutral
"One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.",neutral
"They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.",neutral
"Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.",neutral
"They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.",neutral
"Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--",neutral
"""Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?""",neutral
But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.,neutral
"He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--",neutral
"""Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!",neutral
"A little wee man, in a red red coat!",neutral
"A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.""",neutral
"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.",neutral
"But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--",neutral
"""Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?""",neutral
"But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--",neutral
Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.,surprise
"Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--",neutral
"""A house full, a hole full!",neutral
"And you cannot gather a bowl-full!""",neutral
The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.,neutral
"But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.",neutral
On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.,neutral
They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.,neutral
"Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all.",neutral
"He ran in front, singing--",neutral
But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.,neutral
"On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.",neutral
"Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.",neutral
But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--,neutral
"Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.",neutral
"The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.",neutral
On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.,neutral
They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.,neutral
"But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--",neutral
But he ate up the honey!,neutral
The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.,neutral
"But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.",neutral
"On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.",neutral
Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs he opened one eye and shut it again.,neutral
But still he did not speak.,neutral
Nutkin became more and more impertinent--,neutral
Nutkin began again--,neutral
"Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!",neutral
. . .,neutral
* * * * * * * *,neutral
This looks like the end of the story but it isn't.,neutral
"And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--",anger
Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?,neutral
"In walks the little dog--says ""Pussy are you there?",neutral
How do you do Mistress Pussy?,neutral
"Mistress Pussy, how do you do?""",neutral
"Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.",neutral
I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim.,neutral
"""I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,"" wrote Duchess and then at the end she added--""I hope it isn't mouse?""",neutral
"And then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she gave her letter to the postman.",neutral
"But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.",neutral
And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.,neutral
"A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine just like Ribby's dishes they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.""",neutral
Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.,neutral
"Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven.",neutral
"There were two ovens, one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open.",neutral
Ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff.,neutral
"""The top oven bakes too quickly,"" said Ribby to herself.",neutral
Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth.,neutral
"Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.",neutral
"Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.",neutral
"When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.",neutral
"When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable.",neutral
"Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.",neutral
"And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.",neutral
"Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth.",neutral
"They only bowed to one another they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.",neutral
As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!,neutral
Straight away to Ribby's house!,neutral
Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins.,neutral
Then she went home.,neutral
"There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.",neutral
But there was nobody there.,neutral
"Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.",neutral
I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.,neutral
"I could not turn any of the other handles I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse!",neutral
I cannot think what she has done with it?,neutral
Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby and passed the time until the clock struck four.,neutral
Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.,neutral
"She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob.",neutral
"She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.",neutral
She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.,neutral
"Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party.",neutral
"At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity.",neutral
"""Is Mrs. Ribston at home?"" inquired Duchess in the porch.",neutral
"""Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?"" said Duchess.",joy
"""I've brought you some flowers what a delicious smell of pie!""",joy
"""Oh, what lovely flowers!",joy
"""I think it wants another five minutes,"" said Ribby.",neutral
"""Just a shade longer I will pour out the tea, while we wait.",neutral
"Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?""",neutral
Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--,neutral
"She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.",neutral
Ribby set the pie upon the table there was a very savoury smell.,neutral
"Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.",neutral
"""I will first cut the pie for you I am going to have muffin and marmalade,"" said Ribby.",neutral
"""I think""--(thought Duchess to herself)--""I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it.",neutral
What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!,neutral
"I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.""",neutral
The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!,neutral
"Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.",neutral
"""The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?""",neutral
"""The patty pan that held up the pie-crust,"" said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.",neutral
"""Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby ""I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.""",neutral
"""I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.""",neutral
"""It is impossible, my dear Duchess there was not a patty-pan.""",neutral
"""Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess where do you think you feel it?""",neutral
"""Shall I run for the doctor?""",neutral
"""Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand.""",neutral
"Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.",neutral
She found him at the smithy.,neutral
Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.,neutral
It was most conspicuous.,neutral
All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.,neutral
"""How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!""",surprise
"She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.",sadness
"The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!",neutral
Duchess started!,surprise
. . .,neutral
. . .,neutral
"But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!""",neutral
I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it.,neutral
"When I go home, I will run round and take it away.""",neutral
"She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.",neutral
"""I am truly glad to hear it!",joy
"He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!""",neutral
"""I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,"" said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.",neutral
"""It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!""",neutral
"""I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess.",neutral
"""Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?""",neutral
"""Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess.""",neutral
"Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.",joy
Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back Ribby had gone in and shut her door.,neutral
"Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.",neutral
Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws.,neutral
"The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.",neutral
"Ribby stared with amazement-- ""Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?",surprise

"Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!""",neutral
I have made many books about well-behaved people.,neutral
"Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.",neutral
"Nobody could call Mr. Tod ""nice.""",neutral
He was of a wandering habit and he had foxy whiskers they never knew where he would be next.,neutral
"In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.",neutral
"He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.",neutral
The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved OUT because sometimes Tommy Brock moved IN (without asking leave).,neutral
Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin he grinned all over his face.,neutral
He was not nice in his habits.,neutral
"He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.",neutral
"His clothes were very dirty and as he slept in the daytime, he always went to bed in his boots.",neutral
And the bed which he went to bed in was generally Mr. Tod's.,neutral
"Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit pie but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce.",neutral
Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years.,neutral
"He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.",neutral
"He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family.",neutral
"Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.",neutral
The little rabbit babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick.,neutral
"They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole.",neutral
To tell the truth--old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.,neutral
"He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps.",neutral
Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.,neutral
Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.,joy
"And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........",joy
When Flopsy and Benjamin came back old Mr. Bouncer woke up.,neutral
Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared!,neutral
But the smell of badger was undeniable and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand.,neutral
There was not much difficulty in tracking him he had left his foot- mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood.,neutral
Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.,neutral
There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel and had set a mole trap.,neutral
A little stream crossed the way.,neutral
Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.,neutral
"The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths --but the smell that made Benjamin stop was NOT the smell of flowers!",neutral
"Mr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.",neutral
There was not only a foxy flavor in proof of it--there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.,neutral
"Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring, his whiskers twitched.",neutral
"Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something.",neutral
He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood.,neutral
Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way.,neutral
Upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of,neutral
badger and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.,neutral
"Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow.",neutral
He found another mole trap newly set he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock.,neutral
It was getting late in the afternoon.,neutral
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.,joy
"One of them in a blue coat, by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.-- ""Cousin Peter!",neutral
"""Yes, yes not ten minutes since ... he said they were CATERPILLARS I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.""",neutral
"""He had a sack with something live in it I watched him set a mole trap.",neutral
"Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin tell me from the beginning,"" Benjamin did so.",neutral
Your family is alive and kicking and Tommy Brock has had refreshments.,neutral
"He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.""",neutral
"""Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself.",neutral
I know very well which way.,neutral
"Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks.",neutral
"I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's he said he would be passing.""",neutral
"(Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)",neutral
They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen.,neutral
"He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.",neutral
The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.,neutral
"Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her one black and the others brown.",neutral
Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance.,neutral
Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.,neutral
"They climbed up and up--""He was at home I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole.""",neutral
"""They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.",neutral
"The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks and there, beneath a crag, Mr. Tod had made one of his homes.",neutral
It was at the top of a steep bank the rocks and bushes overhung it.,neutral
"This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pigsty.",neutral
"There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.",neutral
The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame but the kitchen fire was not alight.,neutral
"It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.",neutral
Benjamin sighed with relief.,joy
"There was an immense empty pie dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.",neutral
"At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper.",neutral
"No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits.",neutral
The kitchen was empty and silent the clock had run down.,neutral
"Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.",neutral
Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house.,neutral
"It was damp and smelly, and over- grown with thorns and briars.",neutral
They crept up to the bedroom window.,neutral
It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.,neutral
"But there were signs that this window had been recently open the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the windowsill.",neutral
The room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt.,neutral
"And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--""He has gone to bed in his boots,"" whispered Peter.",neutral
"Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.",neutral
Nothing could be seen of the young family.,neutral
The sun had set an owl began to hoot in the wood.,neutral
"It was a shocking place, and very dark.",neutral
"They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window.",neutral
"They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes but it was of no use, especially without a light.",neutral
"They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.",neutral
In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.,neutral
"It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house, amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.",neutral
"The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor.",neutral
The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace --a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.,neutral
The young family were alive shut up in the oven!,surprise
"Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.",joy
But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.,neutral
They could not open the window and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out they were not old enough to crawl.,neutral
"After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.",neutral
They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.,neutral
They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.,neutral
They dug and dug for hours.,neutral
They could not tunnel straight on account of stones but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.,neutral
Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards.,neutral
"Peter's claws were worn down he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away.",neutral
He called out that it was morning--sunrise and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.,neutral
Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears he cleaned his face with his paws.,neutral
Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.,neutral
"In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.",neutral
They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.,neutral
"Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.",anger
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.,anger
"It was his own fault but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod.",neutral
Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.,anger
"First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp and the otters had left a dead fish near it.",neutral
Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.,neutral
He made his way up the hill his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.,anger
No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.,neutral
Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.,anger
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.,anger
"It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation.",neutral
"He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key.",neutral
He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.,neutral
"The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.",neutral
He turned the rusty key in the lock the rabbits below could hear it.,neutral
Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.,neutral
The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.,anger
"There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar, and his tablecloth, that he had left folded up in the dresser --all set out for supper (or breakfast) --without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.",neutral
"There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.",neutral
"But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise, a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.",neutral
He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.,neutral
Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.,neutral
His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.,anger
"For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again.",neutral
By degrees he ventured further in--right into the bed- room.,neutral
"When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.",anger
"He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.",neutral
He snored peacefully and regularly but one eye was not perfectly shut.,neutral
Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom.,neutral
"Twice he brought in his walking stick, and once he brought in the coal scuttle.",neutral
"But he thought better of it, and took them away.",neutral
"When he came back after removing the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways but he seemed even sounder asleep.",neutral
Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.,neutral
He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores.,neutral
"They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.",neutral
"Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window.",neutral
"Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye--shut it hastily.",neutral
The snores continued.,neutral
"Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather difficult (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom).",neutral
"He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window- sill.",neutral
"The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.",neutral
Tommy Brock snored conscientiously.,neutral
Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute then he left the room again.,neutral
There was a noise outside the window.,neutral
Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.,neutral
"Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house.",neutral
"On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.",neutral
If he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly.,neutral
"His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin but, fortunately, he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work.",neutral
"He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.",neutral
"Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window.",neutral
"Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.",neutral
"Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.",neutral
"Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.",neutral
Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.,neutral
His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.,neutral
"He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.",neutral
(Mr.,neutral
"Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied.",neutral
So was the counterpane.,neutral
Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.),neutral
Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively he really was a first prize sound sleeper!,neutral
It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope across the bed.,neutral
"Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavored to get up again with the pail of water.",neutral
"He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.",neutral
"But, naturally, being a thin- legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope.",neutral
He very nearly overbalanced himself.,neutral
The snores became more and more apoplectic.,neutral
"One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.",neutral
Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.,neutral
"After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug.",neutral
The empty pail was not too heavy for him he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.,neutral
Surely there never was such a sleeper!,neutral
"Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.",neutral
As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees.,neutral
"The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum.",neutral
"Occasionally a drop splashed over but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,--except in one eye.",neutral
At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete.,neutral
"The pail was full of water the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the windowsill to the tree outside.",neutral
"""It will make a great mess in my bedroom but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,"" said Mr. Tod.",neutral
Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.,neutral
"He went out of the house, shutting the front door.",neutral
The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.,neutral
"He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--",neutral
"The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.",joy
"He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.",neutral
"When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying.",neutral
He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.,neutral
He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.,neutral
"At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.",surprise
"Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.",neutral
But no screams.,neutral
Then he peeped in at the window.,neutral
"The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.",neutral
"In the middle of the bed, under the blanket, was a wet SOMETHING --much flattened in the middle, where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy).",neutral
"Its head was covered by the wet blanket, and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.",neutral
"There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop, drip, of water trickling from the mattress.",neutral
Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour his eyes glistened.,neutral
"Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window but the bundle never moved.",neutral
"I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,"" said Mr. Tod.",neutral
"""I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach.",neutral
"And the blanket must be hung up in the wind and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan and warmed with a hot water bottle.""",neutral
"""I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap and soda and scrubbing brushes and persian powder and carbolic to remove the smell.",neutral
"Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.""",neutral
"He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen-- ""First I will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the blanket.",neutral
". . .""",neutral
He opened the door.,neutral
. . .,neutral
"Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's teapot into Mr. Tod's teacup.",neutral
He was quite dry himself and grinning and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.,joy
"Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.",anger
Everything was upset except the kitchen table.,neutral
"And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.",neutral
The crockery was smashed to atoms.,neutral
"The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.",neutral
"The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the cannisters fell off the shelf the kettle fell off the hob.",neutral
Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam.,neutral
And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.,neutral
"As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes.",neutral
"""No they are not.""",neutral
"""What dreadful bad language!",neutral
"I think they have fallen down the stone quarry.""",neutral
"Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--",neutral
"""Be quick, it's all right.",neutral
"Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them.""",neutral
Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!,neutral
"After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.",anger
The day passed heavily.,neutral
Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.,neutral
"She had been having a complete turn out and spring cleaning, to relieve her feelings.",neutral
She had just finished.,neutral
"He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling.",neutral
"He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.",neutral
Can we get away?,neutral
"Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?""",neutral
Peter pricked his ears distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.,neutral
"Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying, half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass.",neutral
"They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.",neutral
Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.,joy
They soon recovered.,neutral
A new long pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer.,neutral
Then Peter and Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.,neutral
"Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.",neutral
They had dear little fur coats of their own and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.,neutral
But one day their mother--Mrs.,neutral
"Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.",neutral
First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).,neutral
Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).,neutral
Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).,neutral
"Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.",neutral
"Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown several buttons burst off.",neutral
His mother sewed them on again.,neutral
"When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.",neutral
You must walk on your hind legs.,neutral
"Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks.""",neutral
Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.,neutral
Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.,neutral
When they stood up there were several green smears!,neutral
"""Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall,"" said Moppet.",neutral
They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.,neutral
Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.,neutral
"He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left.",neutral
He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.,neutral
"Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.",neutral
"While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!",neutral
They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.,neutral
"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.",neutral
Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.,joy
Moppet and Tom descended after her the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.,neutral
"""Come!",neutral
"Mr. Drake Puddle-duck,"" said Moppet.",neutral
"""Come and help us to dress him!",neutral
"Come and button up Tom!""",neutral
Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.,neutral
They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.,neutral
"""It's a very fine morning!"" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.",joy
"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!",neutral
Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.,neutral
"She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.",anger
"""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen I am affronted,"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.",anger
She sent them upstairs and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.,neutral
Quite the contrary they were not in bed: NOT in the least.,neutral
"And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!",neutral
As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.,neutral
"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.",neutral
"And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.",neutral
"Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.",neutral
She lived in a bank under a hedge.,neutral
Such a funny house!,neutral
"There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store- rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.",neutral
"There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.",neutral
"Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!",neutral
"Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.",neutral
Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.,neutral
And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.,neutral
"Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.",neutral
"""Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?""",neutral
She bundled the spider out at a window.,neutral
He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.,neutral
"Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner.",neutral
"All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.",neutral
"""I smell a smell of honey is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?",neutral
"""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble I should be glad to buy some bees- wax.",neutral
But what are you doing down here?,neutral
Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.,anger
"She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.",neutral
Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas the storeroom ought to have been empty.,neutral
But it was full of untidy dry moss.,neutral
Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.,neutral
"Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.",neutral
"""I am not in the habit of letting lodgings this is an intrusion!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.",anger
Buzz!,neutral
"Buzzz!""--""I wonder who would help me?""",neutral
"""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!""",neutral
"--""I will not have Mr. Jackson he never wipes his feet.""",neutral
Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.,neutral
"When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.",neutral
"He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.",joy
"He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.",neutral
"""How do you do, Mr. Jackson?",neutral
"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!",joy
"I'll sit awhile and dry myself,"" said Mr. Jackson.",neutral
"He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.",joy
Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.,neutral
He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?,neutral
First she offered him cherry- stones.,neutral
"""Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!",joy
"No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson.",neutral
He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide he certainly had not a tooth in his head.,neutral
"Then she offered him thistle- down seed--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly!",neutral
"Pouff, pouff, puff."" said Mr. Jackson.",neutral
He blew the thistle- down all over the room.,neutral
"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!",joy
"Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!""",joy
"""I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.",sadness
"Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.",neutral
"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.",neutral
"When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.",neutral
"""Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!""",neutral
"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!""",neutral
First he squeezed into the pantry.,neutral
There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.,neutral
Two of them got away but the littlest one he caught.,neutral
Then he squeezed into the larder.,neutral
Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar but she flew away out of the window.,neutral

Wizz!,neutral
"Wizz!""",neutral
"He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.",neutral
"""Get out, you nasty old toad!"" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.",anger
"""I shall go distracted!"" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.",anger
She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.,neutral
He seemed to have no objection to stings.,neutral
When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.,neutral
She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees- wax.,neutral
"Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.",neutral
"She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom.",neutral
But she was too tired to do any more.,neutral
"First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.",neutral
Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort- night.,neutral
"She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons.",neutral
"When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.",neutral

"With the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly.",joy
"The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.",neutral
"After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.",neutral
"Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle: ""Seven at one stroke.""",neutral
"He must be a mighty lord.""",neutral
"The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke.",joy
"The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal.",neutral
"""For this very reason have I come here,"" the tailor replied, ""I am ready to enter the king""s service.""",neutral
"He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned him.",neutral
"He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel.",neutral
"He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him.",neutral
"If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.",neutral
"""Oh, yes,"" he replied, ""I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.""",neutral
"The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.",neutral
"When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: ""Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.""",neutral
Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left.,neutral
After a while he perceived both giants.,neutral
"They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down.",neutral
"The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree.",neutral
"When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants.",neutral
"For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ""Why are you knocking me?""",anger
"They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second.",neutral
"""What is the meaning of this?"" cried the other ""Why are you pelting me?""",anger
"""I am not pelting you,"" answered the first, growling.",anger
"The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant.",neutral
"""That is too bad!"" cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.",anger
Then the little tailor leapt down.,neutral
"He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ""The work is done I have finished both of them off, but it was hard work!",neutral
"They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.""",neutral
"""Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom,"" said he to him, ""you must perform one more heroic deed.",neutral
"In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.""",neutral
"Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.""",neutral
"He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside.",neutral
He had not long to seek.,neutral
"The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught.",neutral
"The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand.",neutral
"Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their help.",neutral
The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes.,neutral
"Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did.",neutral
"""I""ll put a screw into that business,"" said the little tailor.",anger
"At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again.",neutral
"The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ""Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.",neutral
I smote seven at one blow.,neutral
So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his life.,neutral
"Once on a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb, and did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow one hair""s breadth.",neutral
"Once when the father was going out to plough, the little one said, ""Father, I will go out with you.""",neutral
"""Thou wouldst go out with me?"" said the father.",neutral

"He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him.",neutral
"The giant, however, carried him home, suckled him, and Thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants.",neutral
"When two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest, wanted to try him, and said, ""Pull up a stick for thyself.""",neutral
Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots.,neutral
"But the giant thought, ""We must do better than that,"" took him back again, and suckled him two years longer.",neutral
"When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground.",neutral
"That was still not enough for the giant he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, ""Now just tear up a proper stick for me,"" the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him.",neutral
His father was there following the plough.,neutral
"The young giant went up to him, and said, ""Does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into?""",neutral
"Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.",neutral
"The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, ""Just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the field.""",neutral
"Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once.",neutral
"When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents"" house.",neutral
"The farmer said, ""That is our son.""",neutral
"The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted.",neutral
"When he had done this, he went into the parlour, sat down on the bench and said, ""Mother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?""",neutral
"Then she said, ""Yes,"" and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week.",neutral
"The youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him.",neutral
"""No,"" she replied, ""that is all we have.""",neutral
"""But that was only a taste, I must have more.""",neutral
"She did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge caldron full of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in.",neutral
"""At length come a few crumbs,"" said he, and ate all there was, but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger.",neutral
"Then said he, ""Father, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough if you will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot break against my knees, I will go out into the world.""",neutral
"The youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away.",neutral
"The father then harnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick, that the four horses could only just drag it.",neutral
"So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought one which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only just carry it.",neutral
"So he went away, and gave out that he was a smith""s apprentice.",neutral
"He arrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow, who never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for himself.",neutral
The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.,neutral
"""Yes,"" said the smith, and looked at him, and thought, ""That is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.""",neutral
"So he asked, ""How much wages dost thou want?""",neutral
"""I don""t want any at all,"" he replied, ""only every fortnight, when the other journeymen are paid, I will give thee two blows, and thou must bear them.""",neutral
"Next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again.",neutral
"Then the miser grew angry, and said, ""Oh, but I can""t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully what will you have for the one blow?""",anger
"Then said he, ""I will only give you quite a small blow, that""s all.""",neutral
"And he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay.",neutral
"Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.",neutral
"When he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant.",neutral
"""Yes,"" said the bailiff, ""I can make use of one you look a strong fellow who can do something, how much a year do you want as wages?""",neutral
"He again replied that he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him three blows, which he must bear.",neutral
"Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-servant was still in bed.",neutral
"Then one of them called to him, ""Get up, it is time we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.""",neutral

"The bailiff said they were to awaken him again, and tell him to harness the horses.",neutral
"The head-man, however, said as before, ""Just go there, I shall be back again before any of you.""",neutral
And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.,neutral
"At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood.",neutral
"Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through.",neutral
"When he was entering the wood, the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home then said he to them, ""Drive on, I will still get home before you do.""",neutral

"""Don""t you see,"" said he, ""that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour""s sleep?""",neutral
"He now wanted to drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers.",neutral
"When he was over, he said to the others, ""There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,"" and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.",neutral
"In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, ""Isn""t that a fine bundle of wood?""",neutral
"So he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too.",neutral
"""No,"" said he, ""I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on.""",neutral
"The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything.",neutral
The head-servant consented to this delay.,neutral
"The bailiff summoned all his clerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him advice.",neutral
"The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head and then he would never return to daylight.",neutral
"So the bailiff cried, ""Sh-sh,"" and pretended to frighten the hens away.",neutral
"When the head-servant had finished his work, he climbed up and said, ""Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on,"" and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.",neutral
"The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.",neutral
"The proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted.",neutral
"So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.",neutral
"The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.",neutral
"He said, ""I will manage it, just you go away to bed.""",neutral
"Then he went into the mill, and poured out the corn.",neutral
"About eleven o""clock he went into the miller""s room, and sat down on the bench.",neutral
"When he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large table came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed themselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of itself, for no one was there to carry it.",neutral
"After this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until all at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and laid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing.",neutral
"As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.",joy
"When he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear.",neutral
"And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too struck out.",neutral
And so it continued the whole night.,neutral
"He took nothing without returning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not lay about him in vain.",neutral
"At daybreak, however, everything ceased.",neutral
"When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive.",neutral
"Then the youth said, ""I have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but I have given some in return.""",neutral
"The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward.",joy
"But he said, ""Money, I will not have, I have enough of it.""",neutral
"So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.",neutral
"Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again.",neutral
"Then said the head-servant to the bailiff""s wife, ""If he does not come back, you must take the other blow.""",neutral
"Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew out, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.",neutral
"Her husband cried, ""Do come to me,"" but she replied, ""Come thou to me, I cannot come to thee.""",neutral
"And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.",neutral
"There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone.",neutral

"""If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,"" said the merchant.",neutral
"""Who knows but I may?"" said the little man: ""tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of some use.""",neutral

"""Oh, trouble not yourself about that,"" said the dwarf ""only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.""",neutral
"The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.",neutral
"But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed.",joy
"About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor.",neutral
"At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.",joy
"Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful so that care and sorrow were written upon his face.",sadness
"The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word.",neutral
"Then Heinel said, ""Father, give yourself very little trouble about that I shall be too much for the little man.""",neutral
"When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it.",neutral
At last the boy said to him.,neutral
"""Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?""",neutral
"Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him.",neutral
"""Have you brought me what you said you would?"" said the dwarf to the merchant.",neutral
"The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, ""What do you want here?""",neutral

"""You have cheated and taken in my father,"" said the son ""pray give him up his bond at once.""",neutral
"""Fair and softly,"" said the little old man ""right is right I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.""",neutral
"""You must have my consent to that first,"" said Heinel, ""so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.""",neutral

"So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.",neutral
"Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.",sadness
"The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on.",neutral
"As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted.",neutral
"""Here,"" said he to himself, ""must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.""",neutral
"So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.",neutral
"Now the white snake was an enchanted princess and she was very glad to see him, and said, ""Are you at last come to set me free?",joy

"This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.",neutral

"They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son.",joy
"And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father and he began to long to see him once again.",sadness
"However, he gave her no rest till she agreed.",neutral

"Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad.",neutral
"So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town.",neutral
"The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ""Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?""",neutral
"""Yes,"" said his mother, ""our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.""",neutral

"One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters.",neutral
"Then he sat himself down, and said, ""I am very much tired sit by me, I will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.""",neutral
"As soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom.",neutral

"""I can never go back to my father""s house,"" said he ""they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom.""",neutral
"So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three giants were sharing their father""s goods and as they saw him pass they cried out and said, ""Little men have sharp wits he shall part the goods between us.""",neutral
"Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy""s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ""Heads off!"" a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished.",neutral
"Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them.",neutral

"""No,"" said they ""not unless you undertake not to say, ""Heads off!"" for if you do we are all dead men.""",neutral

As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband.,neutral

"Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?""",neutral
"""One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again but how have you used him?",neutral

And thus she though he would think of the matter no more.,neutral

"When all were ready, the king sent them to her but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot.",neutral

"""You must be a witch, Catskin,"" said the cook ""for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.""",anger
